This is included in the Lightfall + Annual Pass edition or can alternatively be purchased on its own through the Eververse store. It is not included with purchase of Season of the Deep.Players missing their Dungeon Key from purchase of the Lightfall + Annual Pass edition need to log into Destiny 2 on the platform where that purchase was made to unlock the Dungeon Key on their account. At this point it will be available on all platforms linked through Cross Save.Dungeon Keys are applied to individual Bungie accounts and cannot be game shared.Anyone still experiencing issues that do not fall into one of the above categories can reach out to us via our Missing Eververse or Add-On Item contact form where we can investigate further.KNOWN ISSUESWhile we continue investigating various known issues, here is a list of the latest issues that were reported to us in our #Help Forum.Some players are unable to give out Commendations.Players can get stuck outside of the final boss arena after self-reviving in the Ghosts of the Deep dungeon.The Hive symbols in the side rooms of the Ghosts of the Deep dungeon’s final encounter do not respawn within an encounter cycle if a player dies before depositing their Vestige. They will re-appear as expected once players have completed a damage phase.The Sunbracers Exotic Warlock gloves are not extending the duration of Solar grenades.The cooldown timer for The Navigator Exotic Trace Rifle\\'s catalyst is missing a description and will display as a blank timer when activated.Getting frozen while using the Arbor Warden Exotic Titan chest can sometimes cause players to lose the Barri-nade class ability. Respawning after player death or unequipping and re-equipping the Exotic will restore the intended class ability.Getting kills with Skyburner\\'s Oath and Vesper of Radius is causing larger explosions than intended.Some Iron Banner weapons are missing their glare in the Crucible.The Athrys\\'s Embrace Exotic Hunter arms does not display the \"Strengthened Heavy Knife\" popup when activated in the Crucible. Players should note the Exotic is still working as intended, it is only the visual indicator that is missing.Guarding with the Arc Staff super while using the Blight Ranger Exotic Hunter head is consuming extra Super energy.The Stronghold Exotic Titan arms are not always granting the Restoration buff when expected.The new Season of the Deep Exotics are not dropping from the Vex Strike Force activity.For a full list of emergent issues in Destiny 2, players can review our Known Issues article .

updates to enemy elemental shields we have one more update coming with season of the deep one we haven't mentioned until today we are changing how enemy shields look to tell you all about it here's the destiny combat team destiny combat team over the past few years the destiny dev team has introduced numerous changes to the core game experience as we ve overhauled internal systems as well as endeavored to make the game more accessible to our audience the change we are about to talk about touches on both of these topics with the launch of season of the deep we re introducing a change to most combatant shields that will update their visuals across the entire game this update had the explicit goal of not affecting destiny s existing gameplay so this will be a visual-only change this is how shields are nowthis is how shields will look starting next season given that the majority of these shields have been in service since the number of bespoke combatant shields has become more difficult to maintain as we ve significantly expanded the number of enemy combatants in the game to address this challenge we ve made a large backend shift to a new shield system that will be easier to maintain and improve upon which brings us to our next point accessibility when we decided to overhaul this system we took the opportunity to create visuals that are more accessible for colorblind players and players with other visual impairments as such we ve minimized visual information that is not relevant to gameplay in favor of bringing to the foreground more combat-relevant details this primarily takes form in more clearly surfacing the unit s shield element right now the color of combatant shields are the only way a player can tell what the optimal element counter is in the new system launching with season of the deep we ve included more visual artifacts with each shield type that indicates to players which elemental weapon types are best to use as a final detail we d like to note that immunity shields white shields and shields for specific boss encounters will not be receiving this update due to their slightly-more-complicated nature we re avoiding making any broad changes which could unintentionally impact encounter mechanics designs etc stabilizing and now a note from the engineering team as part of the work to prepare for lightfall we embarked on a large technical upgrade to improve our destiny services and hardware this work included updating our services to use new technologies as well as preparing for hardware upgrades in the long run this investment in the back end of destiny should lead to a more stable and reliable experience for all players and faster recovery in instances where service downtime does occur the launch of lightfall was a great example of this with high stability and uptime for both launch day and the root of nightmares world first race however as millions of players have interacted with these services we have discovered some issues that we are working on addressing a prime example of this is our background service update system typically several days before one of our tuesday updates we will stage the update on our servers this upgrades our backend services to the new version and means that during the tuesday patch we only take a brief amount of downtime before letting players back into the game however with our new libraries and code we ve discovered cases where the background update has put our services into a bad state forcing us to bring destiny offline for extended maintenance so what are we doing about this we have a team focused on making corrections to our new services so that we can safely perform background updates again however while we do that work we also want to make sure your destiny experience is as predictable as possible therefore starting with season of the deep's launch update we are moving to a scheduled downtime model where we bring destiny offline for an expected hours on our update days this will allow us to do our staging and rollout on the same day and should make the experience more stable and reliable in the meantime we will continue to monitor performance upgrade hardware increase service reliability and work to give you a great experience each time you play the game guardian games are coming to an end it's the final week of the guardian

quick preview of an ability-balance article we ll be posting next week we wanted to provide more clarity on the change to the ashes to assets and hands on armor mods in the patch notes we released after update went live earlier this week our patch notes made it sound like when both the ashes to assets and hands on are equipped only one of the mods will work in reality these mods can still be used at the same time and the change here is that defeating an enemy specifically with the grapple melee will no longer double dip and count as both a grenade and melee kill this change was made to make the grapple melee consistent with how other abilities in the game interact with these mods on the subject of strand abilities we re generally happy with how strand is performing and we re continuing to monitor data and player sentiment as we move forward we ll be balancing strand over time but in the short term we re making some strand changes in season as part of a larger

and well-suited for lightfall another big shout out to stellarstatelogic you can acquire the new ornament in the eververse store next exotic weapon ornament votefashion in destiny is a vital part of the game and some of us can be pretty invested in using the right ornaments to make our guardians shine but armor isn t the only thing that s important that is why we re announcing the next community weapon ornament voting and we have a selection of awesome weapons you can choose from the design behind the chosen ornament will be created by an artist from our destiny community who are amazing when it comes to bringing the game into the real world through art we have picked an artist out so please don t feel the need to start any campaigns on whom we should pick we also aren t asking them to do this work for free and will be paying them just like when we work with other external concept artists so here are the chosen weapons izanagi s burden witherhoard thunderlord once one of the above exotics has been selected we will work with the chosen community artist to create three different weapon ornament concepts and then we will have another vote so that you can pick your favorite the winning design will be made into a weapon ornament in the game here is a quick look at the full process starting on april the community votes through email on which exotic to pick the community artist creates three ornament concepts for the winning exotic weapon the community votes on their favorite concept the winning weapon ornament goes into production and is released in-game we want to make sure we give our artist plenty of time to work so it will take some time until we reveal them and the concepts once the community has picked the concept and it s ready to go into production it s going to take a bit of time to go through our content pipeline so we want to set the expectation up front that you shouldn't expect to see the ornament in destiny until the final shape we know that might seem like a long way out but we re glad you get to be along for the ride on this one and an important part of that process we can t wait for the results choose wisely guardians last week of iron

bit trials of osiris available in week weekly grandmaster nightfalls available in week conqueror gilding node is still planned for week that's a lot to chew even as bullet points but if you are really into destiny and want to know what's coming we suggest you go read the whole article who wants to be a conqueror season s grandmaster nightfalls start on april those who have yet to earn the conqueror seal for the first time will only be able to complete one nightfall a week if that's your case be ready for proving grounds and remember to find proper cover in each room everyone who has already earned the seal and are gunning to gild it can complete the six featured nightfalls as quickly as they would like even in one sitting as is tradition during season we have two additional adept weapons available the buzzard a kinetic adaptive sidearm with awesome perks like the brand-new kinetic tremors and the swarm the arc machine gun that has been refreshed with new perks like target lock don't forget about the other adept weapons though you still have a chance to get that perfect wendigo gl or the classic hung jury and since there s been a few changes to hard content with the launch of lightfall here's a reminder of how grandmaster nightfalls work in case you need it your power level caps levels below the activity level for season that means combatants will be but you will be at the most combatants can take more hits deal more damage and are quite aggressive champions will be abundant so be sure to have the proper weapons to deal with them there's one burn that will cause you to receive more damage from a certain element also two elemental surges and overcharged weapons both granting a damage increase revives are limited and after a certain amount of time darkness will encroach and you won't be able to revive or be revived for a more detailed explanation on how those variables will affect you and your teammates you can check this article about challenging content in destiny and as a final note we know some heist battlegrounds feel tough right now so here are some of the adjustments coming in the season mid-season update to make them more manageable heist

       " Document(page_content=\"happy twabsday guardians this week we are back with quite a bit of crucible information some changes to guardian ranks and more first up we want to give you a little refresher of what we talked about last week tl dr of last week s twab we got to celebrate with the world first race winners art of lightfall developer insight video shared updates to commendations and guardian ranks an exotic quest arrived trials of osiris came back iron banner updates and rewards updates from the destiny player support team our movie of the week and art of the week picks here s what s coming today tribute to lance reddick crucible blog tl dr raid master and challenge mode starts next week guardian rank updates destiny player support updates the movie of the week and art of the week picks lance reddick - on friday we all learned of the tragic news of lance reddick s passing at the age of as the voice of commander zavala the stalwart commander of the vanguard lance brought to life a character who has become virtually synonymous with destiny itself for nearly a decade guardians around the world have found purpose and comfort in zavala s presence bolstered by that unmistakable voice so full of strength serenity and nobility the tributes that have poured in for lance have been overwhelming from endless heartfelt messages on social media to impromptu gatherings of respect in zavala s corner of the tower overlooking the last city as an actor musician gamer and family man the passion lance brought to the things he loved was reflected in the eyes and hearts of all who loved him for now we will honor his presence through his performances yet to come in the game and in the memories that will last us a lifetime we are deeply saddened by his passing but so thankful for the time we spent together and our thoughts are with his friends and loved ones thank you for everything lance we will miss you pic twitter com csxjkcmojy bungie bungie march did you see our graphs yesterday we released our lightfall crucible update blog post we aren t going to repost all words here but here s a summary of everything we covered updates to how maps and game modes are weighted matchmaking adjustments and an explanation of fireteam matchmaking competitive matchmaking and how skill rating works future competitive rewards and quality-of-life updates upcoming iron banner and trials of osiris plans new and returning game modes if you want to dive into the rest of the blog you can read more here we hope this helps answer some of your questions about our upcoming plans for the crucible feel free to share your kind and constructive feedback over on our destiny team account raid master mode and challenge rotation starts next week it s time guardians raid weekly challenges are here raid master difficulty offers a higher challenge and greater rewards including armor with a weekly rotating stat focus the weekly challenges add an optional hidden objective to one encounter each week that when completed grant extra loot on normal difficulty they drop double rewards when cleared on master difficulty they reward an adept raid weapon as noted in a previous article enhancing master root of nightmares adept weapons will be possible allowing the traits that rolled on the weapon to be upgraded this capability will not be immediately available when the master raid launches and will arrive in the mid-season patch the raid adept weapons you acquire prior to this patch will still be able to be enhanced so you'll want to avoid throwing out any good rolls before master difficulty releases we wanted to talk about two issues pertaining to root of nightmares the first being nezarec s behavior sometimes nezarec doesn't always respond to players when they are standing in a well of radiance in a future update we will be updating this behavior which in turn should make nezarec feel more like the final god of pain while it is our philosophy to avoid making dramatic tuning changes to an activity once it is live we feel it better to address the responsiveness of the boss and accept that it may alter current strategies and increased the level of challenge the second issue we d like to discuss is around the jump pads that can be found throughout root of nightmares specifically in the second encounter scission the jump pads are a tool to help players cross large areas while allowing players to use strand if they d like to circumvent using the jump pads we ve noticed that players with higher framerates usually above fps but not below fps could be unintentionally killed or almost killed by using the jump pads we're investigating a change to address the issue in an upcoming release guardian ranks updates as we ve watched new and veteran players alike work through their guardian ranks since lightfall s launch we realized the legendary and master lost sector objectives were placed a bit too early in the progression in today s update we've moved both the solo completion and solo flawless objectives up to a higher guardian rank so fewer players will hit the same bottleneck at rank legend lost sector guardian rank objectives have moved from rank to rank master lost sector guardian rank objectives have moved from rank to rank combined with last week s reduction to commendations targets in ranks through these changes will make for a smoother progression path for everyone through the guardian ranks system we're also working on a broader rank remix in the near future to improve the process even further destiny player support my immortal smg the player support team is back this week and ready to share their known issues known issues list help forums bungie help twitter known issues while we continue investigating various

say there s several of them upon your first completion your fireteam or just you if you re brave enough will be awarded the very cool exotic glaive called vexcalibur it s a special weapon and not only because of the special ammunition it fires its perk allows you to build a replenishable void overshield and you can also craft and enhance it in order to do the latter you ll have to wield your fancy new glaive while exploring the various angles of the vex network that this quest opens use your head but also your glaive s shield to go farther each week then craft your personalized version of vexcalibur and make an old friend proud although there s no lady of the lake in this story if you find yourself in front of a certain radiolarian pool do your old friend a favor and assert your authority over whatever repurposed mind you might find around the saint awaitstrials of osiris is back a week earlier than initially planned but we re certain you re all more than prepared the reason for this change is already known see last week s twab it has nothing to do with saint s well-deserved paid time off nor valus forge s tight schedule but with an issue we re fixing today first an important note fireteam matchmaking is enabled in trials and as such we ve removed the freelance node we've been analyzing v data in competitive division this season without freelance in place and we re confident fireteam matchmaking provides a solid experience more details soon so trials of osiris is back and there are new rewards on the menu first we have the immortal a brand new rpm strand legendary submachine gun that can roll with some crazy perks like rangefinder and killing wind i ll be looking for that combination for sure then there s astral horizon a kinetic aggressive frame shotgun returning with some new perks worry not slideshot surplus and opening shot are still there but i would keep an eye on shot swap or elemental capacitor if i were you don t forget that the trials of osiris reward system has been slightly changed to work the same way as other tower vendors instead of carrying your earned engrams with you they ll stay with saint- until you decode them apart from the currently featured ones there's the option to focus weapons and armor sets that are no longer in rotation for a certain number of engrams and resources trials engrams from previous seasons can t be used in this new system and must be decrypted at master rahool iron banner returns next week we previously announced that we would be running iron banner three times each season again starting in season as a reminder we also increased iron banner reputation gains from winning matches starting in the final week of iron banner in season adjusted the balance of multipliers between challenges and gear and significantly increased the multiplier for wearing an emblem in season players will be able to claim this emblem at rank on the first reset of iron banner so more players will have a chance to equip it and start earning more rep the iron banner modes we ve launched over the past three seasons rift eruption and fortress have performed well and while we have more ideas for interesting variations on existing standard modes we re going to take a breath before introducing more iron banner modes we ll share more information on these game modes in a future blog in the meantime we ll be running three different modes one each week next week will be the old favorite iron banner control week will be eruption and week will be fortress but what about the rewards we ve

crucible or strikes or gambit or anything with a commendations screen all the other guardians and sometimes you can disappear well the fix is scheduled to go live on march two days after the start of iron banner and we don't want to have our premiere iron banner start off with two days of invisible guardians or everyone playing iron banner restarting destiny every hour so we re making the tough decision to delay iron banner a week that means a couple things good news for trials fans we will be moving trials of osiris up to next weekend instead since the issue should be fixed before friday morning more info in next week's twab of course where you can expect a double dose of crucible event goodness there will only a be a one-week break between the first iron banner week ends on and the

challenges you to embark on win streaks for as long as they can destiny classes explainedthere are three classes available for you to choose from when crafting your ideal guardian to level up more quickly and to explore the radically different abilities each class brings to a fight we suggest running more than one character if you have the time one character of each subclass here s what you need to know about destiny subclasses when choosing the one that s right for you destiny classes huntersagile known for their mobility and stealth and perfect for those that favor rogue classes warlocksstrategists and if wanted excellent healers ideal for those who favor magic classes titansif you like to punch titans are for you this class is perfect for those that favor tank classes like warriors and barbarians they also have powerful shielding capabilities for protecting the entire fireteam subclasses what's your destiny playstyle subclasses are where your character masters a combat style unique to their class rooted heavily in the elements here s a quick breakdown of the available options solarscorch your enemies and heal your allies arcbecome lightning itself and unleash your fury voidunleash pure destruction and protect your fireteam the below subclasses are available for those with the beyond light and lightfall expansions respectively stasisfreeze your foes and change the battlefield strandweave the fabric of the cosmos to create new mobility options and suspend your enemies these subclass skill trees will vary depending on the class chosen but each has their role when in combat for example warlocks are often heavily relied upon in higher-level content like raids for their well of radiance a healing ability in the solar subclass whereas titans are favored for their high-damage thundercrash super ability within the arc subclass hunters are also useful fireteam members particularly because of their invisibility as well as abilities across all subclasses that aid in making sure they can get to anywhere on the battlefield as quickly and safely as possible there is unmistakable power in each subclass the choice is up to you on what styles fit you the best you can also build up your subclass by unlocking more aspects and fragments which you can do through ikora for arc solar and void stasis power grows with aspects and fragments from the exo stranger on europa what is a power level how leveling works in destiny just like many games leveling up your character and upgrading your gear is important it gets you combat-ready and shows off that hard-earned progress your power level number shows the current level of your character and is calculated as the average of your armor and weapon gear's power pay attention to more difficult content if you re way below the recommended power level for a particular instance brace for a much more challenging fight when leveling up your seasonal artifact will also be crucial since this will help increase your power level from your base level pre-artifact this progress will also unlock valuable mods to help make your loadout even more potent if you've got the time running all three guardian classes when completing pinnacle and powerful bounties is the most efficient way to level up your power to find out what you need to do depending on the activity hover over the area where you ll see a distinct quest symbol is marked on your destination map with a description on where to go next and what the objective is seasonal power capit's important to remember that pinnacles and powerfuls will only increase your power if you aren t already at the seasonal cap before diving into the different types of rewards for leveling up your character let s look at the different leveling milestones that you should be aware of base gear level with lightfall all players will start at the base power floor of legendary gear cap also referred to as soft cap this is the level where rare blue gear will no longer offer power increases rare gear will no longer drop after surpassing this level powerful gear cap at this power level standard legendary gear drops will no longer offer power increases to further increase power you ll want to heavily invest your time in activities that offer pinnacle rewards learn more about the different reward drops including how to get pinnacles further down in this guide pinnacle gear cap also referred to as hard cap once you ve hit that pinnacle cap you re going to want to brave the more difficult content like grandmaster nightfalls gms raids and dungeons remember seasonal artifact resets each season so the power level you re at in one season isn t necessarily forever what s the difference between legendary powerful and pinnacle gear in destiny good

destiny weapons and armor even the best guardians need top-grade gear in order to get the job done and there s a few different ways to get the weapons and armor you want but first you need to know about the different types of gear to make sure you re on the right rewards path for you at your speed the background color of a weapon is a great starting point for understanding its value white common green uncommon blue rare both common and rare gear can be used as leveling fodder and can be destroyed for materials don t worry about investing in this loot type purple legendary gold exotic

special ammo weapons can appear in the kinetic or energy slot heavy ammo weapons can only appear in the power slot note that some exotic weapons use a non-standard damage type for example a specific exotic hand cannon might use special ammo special weapons require green ammo bricks that can be found in the wild and at rally flags at the start of certain instances anything in your power slot requires purple ammo both ammo types go by their respective names of special and heavy and both can be made easier to find by equipping the right mods we ll get into that in a bit primary ammo is unlimited you just need to make sure you re not reloading when being totally swarmed by enemies it happens we're not here to judge destiny weapon crafting explainedyou also don t have to wait until you find your perfect weapon roll a weapon with a specific set of perks desired by you you can also craft them to get started head to the enclave on mars there you'll find everything you need to start crafting once you ve unlocked a desired weapon pattern by either leveling up a weapon marked by a red border or dismantling one that allows for pattern extraction here s the basic rundown not every weapon is craftable by design to keep the thrill of finding that beloved roll non-crafted weapons have been designed to go toe-to-toe with crafted weapons enhancing a weapon that has dropped for you while playing destiny allows you to level it up use mementos and gain access to both enhanced perks and enhanced intrinsic properties but only the enhanced versions of the perks and masterwork that are already on the version of the weapon you are enhancing enhancing allows you to take a randomly rolled weapon and enhance the perk already present once the pattern for a certain weapon is unlocked head to the enclave and choose shape or re-shape to start crafting that perfect weapon of your dreams what you need to know about stats in destiny when building your perfect guardian there are a few stats you ll want to pay attention to certain stats are more valuable depending on your class mix and match find your style and go ham and don t worry if it takes a little bit to find the style that s right for you that s ok play around and have fun mobilityideal for huntersfocuses on mobility and improving overall movement resilienceideal for titansoffers increased damage reduction recoveryideal for warlockshealth regenerates faster discipline - grenade cooldown reduction intellect - super cooldown reduction strength - melee cooldown reduction now that we know the base formula for buildcrafting let s talk about actual buildcrafting what is buildcrafting and what's the best way to build in destiny buildcrafting is the art of creating a build that makes sense for your playstyle that makes you even more powerful with some strategic planning the art of buildcrafting has progressed a lot since destiny and this is something we are going to continue to evolve season over season but here s what you need to know about the here and now first let s talk about mods and how they are important with the newly implemented loadouts feature mods and how they workmods are a vital component to buildcrafting for example some instances will contain a specific type of enemy called champions and to efficiently defeat them guardians will need to specify their damage output this is done through mod components that can be slotted onto armor pieces for some additional perks how to get mods guardian rank progression seasonal artifact progression a critical change to note here is that with lightfall you don t have to slot these artifact mods now called perks into an armor mod slot this allows for more tailored customization and automatically applies the desired perk effect to the appropriate weapons for example if you unlock the anti-barrier pusle rifle mod it will apply to all pulse rifles automatically previously unlocked mods will be in your collections with the changes made to prepare for lightfall not all pre-lightfall builds will be doable a new way to stun champions overload now stuns with arc jolt void suppression and stasis slow effectsbarrier now stuns with builds that favor certain buffs like solar radiantunstoppable now stuns with arc blind solar ignition and stasis shatterremember earlier when we were talking about how champion enemies require specialized damage outputs to defeat with lightfall we're giving players even more options to take on tough opponents for example you can now stun champion opponents using subclass abilities you will be able to pick up to perks to unlock from the seasonal artifact at any given time so you will need to be strategic about how you want to play if you play around with a specific build and it does not work out you can always reset your artifact mod to make whatever changes you see fit to give you the power you need to face off against the enemies of humanity elemental wells have been a way for players to get back ability energy faster as part of building into a specific playstyle with combat-style mods however this has evolved and been replaced by a few exciting buffs that are associated with fragments the effect is still largely the same only broader to create orbs of power which are tiny orbs of light that are generated when running through various activities they help you with healing with replenishing ability energy and more what replaced elemental wells void breaches voidstasis shards stasisstrand tangles strandif you liked warmind cells you should especially check this out firesprite solariconic traces arcloadoutsthis is a recent feature that debuted with lightfall that allows you to easily switch between sets when building for certain activities for example an armor and weapon build for pvp will typically look vastly different than that of a pve build this system allows players to swap between carefully crafted builds with the touch of a button you can save

socketed armor mods that were previously based on weapon archetype are now based on weapon damage type most armor mods that are based on weapon damage type also have a harmonic version which is discounted when the weapon's damage type matches your subclass damage type armor mod costs have been generally reduced across the board the combat style mod socket has been deprecated and replaced on all armor pieces with an extra socket for mods associated with that armor slot helmet gauntlets etc the charged with light and elemental wells armor mods have been merged into a single system armor charge players using the armor charge system can gain up to three stacks of armor charge at a time expanded up to six stacks by equipping charged up mods picking up an orb of power grants one stack of armor charge many mods that previously created elemental wells or granted stacks of charged with light directly have been modified to instead spawn orbs of power mods that provide an ongoing benefit such as font of wisdom now grant that benefit as long as you have stacks of armor charge these mods cause armor charge stacks to decay every seconds some redundant mods have been deprecated when their effect would overlap with an existing mod's effects some armor mods such as the kickstart mods and most mods triggered by using a finisher now make use of the armor charge system some of the functionality of elemental wells and their associated mods have been moved into subclass fragments and the new firesprite and void breech warmind cells have been deprecated seasonal artifactunlocking

intended to decrease how easy it is to get and maintain a x empowerment bonus in pve as well as reduce the total amount of bonus ability energy provided the goal is for heart of inmost light to remain

       " Document(page_content=\"this week at bungie we re sharing a lot of information with you all mostly because we re as hyped as everyone else but also because lightfall is launching in less than five days that leaves us with about checks clock does the math checks with google because i m bad with numbers less than hours by the time this is live it's enough time to tell you one or two more things though or several so let's start with what's on the menu today get ready for the new lightfall trailer did you read the bringing challenge back to destiny crucible updates going live with lightfall new details on mod customization loadouts guardian ranks and commendations a preview of the season artifact perks an update on the legendary campaign the witch queen free weekend kicks off today prime gaming rewards reminder updates from our beautiful destiny support team some of our community's outstanding creations also here's what we talked about the previous week that you should totally check if you haven't you read our lightfall and the year ahead article right did you watch the vidoc crafty changes coming to weapon crafting that season ending cinematic hit hard new destiny branded steelseries drip lightfall ritual weapons and ornaments incoming with all that clear the only thing left is to jump in vamos let's go new trailer coming today we re not kidding when we say our end begins have you seen how powerful our enemies are well you'll see in just a few hours when the launch trailer for lightfall premieres during playstation s state of play the livestream begins at pm pst check your local time here and a lot of other great games will be a part of it so put on something nice will you the hard waythis week the world systems team shared an overview of the changes coming to several activities long story short destiny is getting harder not only for those of you who love to solo grandmaster nightfalls but also for those who love the kind of challenges that power level disadvantages bring to the table those are here to stay here s a quick recap we explained surges threats and overcharges strike refreshes and a new vanguard ops scoring system power level disadvantages will make nightfalls more challenging lost sectors raids dungeons and more pve activities will be more challenging on legend and master difficulties there were a few things we didn t make completely clear in the article so we updated it with some additional info we saw the feedback and realized that we totally missed some of the reward changes coming to nightfalls and lost sectors as well as some additional info on burns vs threats and surges go read the updated article now rank up guardianmaking your in-game merits more obvious and giving others the opportunity to say nice things about how you played surely must feel nice that's why guardian ranks and commendations are crucial additions to destiny we re also revamping the buildcrafting experience for all players with our new mod customization system and giving everyone the ability to create and switch builds on the fly with the addition of in-game loadouts we know you might have some questions around how these new quality-of-life systems work so we ve got some more details from the team over on the playstation blog today the crucible beckonswe know you re waiting for more news regarding the crucible we have a few quick bits to share before launch and then later in the season we'll have the bigger article with more details on playlist changes coming with lightfall and later adjustments to competitive progression and rewards and changes to how matchmaking will work in the near future next week the competitive division freelance node is going away as we believe fireteam matchmaking is solving the problem it was originally intended to solve in a much healthier way this will merge the player populations into one larger healthier pool while still protecting smaller fireteams from getting stomped by larger more coordinated groups competitive quality-of-life changes coming in season placement changes you can now place in platinum division after your initial placement series matches if you were adept or ascendant in the previous season mode and map weighting while we understand not everyone loves rift and showdown we believe that those two modes stress crucible players in different and important ways and that a variety of kill and objective modes makes for a healthier ladder however we are lowering how common rift and showdown come up on in play while rng can give any sequence of maps and modes we expect survival to show up roughly of the time and rift and showdown to split the other we have also adjusted the individual map weightings for showdown to eliminate maps the mode does not play well on overall we have increased the weight of javelin- endless vale and altar of flame in competitive division and removed disjunction and cathedral of dusk from the rotation entirely as of the start of season you can gild the glorious title by reaching the adept division as well as a number of other crucible triumphs exotic armor pieces can be just as critical to your pvp build as your weapons or subclass aspects or fragments a popular move has always been to have a powerful neutral game exotic on during pvp while your super is building then swap to a super-enhancing exotic once your super is full then swapping back to the neutral game exotic this tends to favor players who have higher end pcs and can get in and out of menus faster and we generally don't want to encourage a bunch of menu gameplay during action we also find it an uninteresting way to gain an advantage in pvp with the prevalence of build swapping that can happen with loadouts we thought we would squash this issue in high-end pvp in season we are introducing the notswap modifier to trials of osiris and competitive division in activities with notswap if you change your exotic armor during the match all of your ability energy is removed just like if you swapped your subclass we will be monitoring gameplay and community discussion around this issue but we are not currently planning on adding it to gambit or other crucible playlists we are also not planning on adding it to any pve modes anywhere it might provide a meaningful advantage already has equipment locked more details to come in a crucible blog post next season until then go make shaxx proud and get ready to build and save your perfect pvp loadout next week embrace the passive artifactthe seasonal artifact has been with us for a while now and we have adjusted its functionalities to better suit how you face some of the most challenging activities in destiny and to spice up the meta a bit each season we re making several improvements to it in lightfall starting with the following artifact mods are now artifact perks these are passive and you don't have to slot them into armor pieces once you unlock an artifact perk it automatically applies to your guardian twelve perks are unlockable per character you can reset the artifact at no cost any number of times the anti-champion weapons featured on the artifact can also be overcharged in higher difficulty activities to accommodate these changes artifice armor has now has a unique mod slot that grants three additional points to a character stat of your choice this change is retroactive to all artifice armor but why tell you when we can show here's what the ascendant scepter brings to the table for season column anti-barrier sidearms - your equipped

damage new ways to defeat championsin our buildcrafting evolved article we stated that there will be new ways to counter champions in lightfall after showcasing the seasonal weapons you'll use to do so maybe we should also refresh that information and throw in one or two more details right you can use an exotic with an anti-champion intrinsic perk eriana's vow divinity or leviathan's breath are three examples you can use weapons that have an anti-champion artifact perk you can use the following subclass verb and status effects barrier champions radiant volatile rounds and unraveling rounds overload champions jolt suppression and slow unstoppable champions ignite blind shatter and suspend the verbs work no matter how they are triggered two examples if you are radiant because a solar hunter used an acrobatic dodge near you you will shoot anti-barrier rounds until radiant wears off if you use a weapon with the chill clip perk the slow effect upon direct hits will stun overload champions and the shatter upon a second hit will stun unstoppables while radiant though the same weapon would pierce a barrier champions but not stun overloads exotics with an anti-champion status effect won't get the pierce effect when applying radiant one example ager's scepter will slow and stun an overload champion but not pierce a barrier one even if the player is radiant there's an exception for weapons able to scorch since ignitions require build-up in order to stun become legendwhether you re a solo player or in a full fireteam there s no wrong way to play the lightfall campaign we know you all loved the legendary difficulty that debuted with the witch queen so we wanted to talk a bit about how it will work in lightfall with the goal of balancing challenge and survivability across all fireteam sizes legendary difficulty scales based on the size of your fireteam incoming damage damage required to stagger an enemy enemy health and amount of revives are a few of the things that scale on legendary for each additional member of your fireteam in the lightfall campaign we reduced the health scalar on combatants to better balance solo and fireteam play when compared to last year s legendary campaign enemies will still have more overall health in larger fireteams and the cabal in general have higher base health than other combatant factions but this will help bring solo and fireteam difficulty closer together additionally the damage required to stagger combatants is reduced during the lightfall campaign make no mistake the shadow legion and their new technology are extremely formidable foes and we re not even going to talk about tormentors so eyes up guardian because it won't be easy free throne world toursthis weekend we're making all the content

after this week s hotfix we have eliminated another source of blue engrams now once you hit the soft power cap powerful enemies that used to have a small chance of dropping a blue engram will now drop a purple engram instead while more valuable this replacement doesn't relieve as much inventory or postmaster pressure as we would like and we ll need an additional update to get us to our ultimate goal early in lightfall we re planning to have powerful enemies instead drop glimmer and occasionally a purple engram whenever they would have dropped a blue engram to help keep your postmaster inventory clean additionally we ve recently boosted gunsmith reputation gains from other sources by to help everyone rank up with banshee- even faster lightfall maintenance downtimejust before

end of the season and a note on yesterday s downtime similar to last week we had another blog post go live yesterday sharing some economy updates and more changes coming in lightfall here is a quick breakdown of everything we talked about umbral engramsada- 's futurevanguard and nightfall focusingfocusing costslegacy focusinglegacy match rewardsand if you want to read more you totally can after you finish the twab alright let's get into the news for today shall we yesterday s triumphs fix and rollbackearlier this week we released hotfix shortly after reports came in that many triumphs seals and catalysts were missing we discovered that the issue was caused when some currently incompletable edz and nessus triumphs were moved from forsaken into the archived triumphs section to make that change we used a tool that can move player state from one location to another in the player s account this tool is very powerful but requires careful and cautious handling due to a configuration error we accidentally re-ran an older state migration process used for the beyond light release as a result we ended up re-copying old data from before beyond light into the current configuration essentially undoing certain aspects of player progression since then once we identified that the issue resulted in a loss of player state we took the game down and rolled back the player database while we investigated how to remove the dangerous change from the build last night we constructed a patch for that removed the specific change that was causing the issue tested it and deployed it to live as a result of this fix all player accounts had to be rolled back to am pst on january this means that any progress made between and am was lost and all purchases refunded you can find more details at our new destiny team account here thanks again for your patience while we sorted this out it s a creepy crawly lifeare you ready guardians it s that time of year where we get to vote on our festival of the lost armor themes make sure you keep reading because we did change things up a bit this year but if you have any questions feel free to sound off on socials to get into the changes more specifically in past years two festival of the lost armor themes were developed e g monsters and dinosaurs then the voting occurred at the theme level and voting was aggregated across classes in one of the big changes we are making to our voting is making voting class-specific last year voting was very close but it wasn't consistent across classes to help make sure each class gets the armor set they're most excited about we've decided to let each class vote individually rather than bucketing armor sets together to address some of the logistic issues with that approach we're trying something a little different with the concepts instead of making two themes we've chosen creepy crawlies as this years theme you ll be voting on two different interpretations a spooky spider style or a bone-chilling beetle body this means that if titans want to live the arachnid life and hunters can't live without glowing wings everybody wins how you vote is changing a little bit as well to accommodate these updates if you signed up for emails via your bungie account you ll receive an email allowing you to vote for your primary class for example if you re a hunter main you ll receive a hunter email we know a lot of you play more than one class and others haven't been able to receive our emails for one reason or another if you're in one of those two groups we have a solution for you as well we ll have a separate voting link where you can submit your votes for your secondary class or your primary if you didn't get the email these votes will then be blended into the same pool as the others lastly we have a quick disclaimer these are draft concepts while we don't plan on changing them we reserve the right to do so we're saying this because if our art team comes up with an awesome way to make them even cooler we want the flexibility to make those changes they're masters of their craft and we want to leave them the space to do what they do best upcoming content changesnext week we re planning to deploy some new updates to help everyone complete their collections this season weekly deepsight red border weapon focusing from the exo frame at the h e l m will be adjusted to daily availability for the remainder of the season to help players craft those final weapons before lightfall arrives this will also apply to vendors offering guaranteed deepsight weapon

multipliers you get from wearing iron banner gear halving the multipliers you get for completing challenges and significantly increasing the multiplier you get for wearing an iron banner emblem we expect this to decrease the number of games needed to earn a rank reset by around and make it more worthwhile to play earlier in the week additionally starting next season iron banner will be

station and added to our hearts we wanted to share just a little more about this sweet dog and how it came to be each season we spend a bit of time brainstorming fun little easter eggs and for this season everyone wanted to build a robot dog but it wasn't that easy after the team came up with the idea the first question was can i pet it and we knew the answer had better be yes so we quickly performed this interesting test to confirm that petting the dog was indeed possible with that settled the next question was what does it look like so our team concepted this doggo here then after tons of folks added their own creative contributions across many teams we finally had archangel the good boy below we know a lot of you really like archie and are concerned about their future they are leaving the h e l m at the end of the season but they will be returning to the tower in season for more pets bungie store update our goal in creating real world made-to-order merchandise is to give

generosity and support of our mission it's a secret to everybody there were some rumors swirling around that bungie was done making secrets forever while the record was corrected we wanted to talk a bit about this subject and the feedback we have been seeing from players hungry for surprise content here is assistant game director robbie stevens to share some of our thoughts robbie stevens we wanted to take a moment to address the community s feedback around secrets in destiny but before we get started if you take one thing away from this communication let it be that the people working on destiny believe that secrets are an important part of this franchise and we re dedicated to delivering secret experiences both small and large throughout the coming year first and foremost let s address the reddit ama about the difficulty of encrypting content that brought this conversation to a head datamining and leaks are not unique problems to destiny every live game deals with this issue because it s one of the most challenging engineering problems in games today that said our communication was misinterpreted to mean that we were no longer building secret experiences which is false we ve delivered hidden and secret story beats and content this year and will continue to do so next year for some in the community secrets have come to mean either a secret mission or a puzzle it s understandable that the community is hungry for more of this content and is interpreting any hidden thing we do as a signpost of something bigger to come just understand that we ll never openly reveal a secret mission or puzzle before it goes live and that although we re intentionally hiding things for you to discover in every release not every secret can be something as big as a mission or puzzle looking back on the past year the witch queen was a release containing a fair share of secrets and the experiences on the throne world were directly influenced by content like secret missions and dungeons additionally as many of you have noticed we ve been layering teases and secrets about future content throughout our stories lore entries and world-building leading up to lightfall however we know that you want more we know that we haven t released a secret mission that scratches the same itch as presage zero hour or the whisper this year those missions were some of the most challenging content for our teams to build which is why we ve only released at most one secret mission within a twelve-month period but as we ve developed our plans leading to lightfall and beyond i want to reassure you that the community s feedback is heard loud and clear and putting more secrets into destiny is an initiative our teams have been working on for months before this conversation recently came to a head some secrets will be small some will be large some will come next year and some are right around the corner but i promise you that we ve got a talented group of people who love this type of content and who know what it means for the community to discover and experience it fashion accessory of the season the hidden blade last week we asked you to create cool and imaginative versions of destiny and ubisoft characters and you certainly delivered whether it was as an art submission a fun short movie or a nice outfit made out of cloaks and hidden blades all your creations were amazing and we loved checking them out in the leapintothelight hashtag choosing the winners was not easy but i think we've managed to make a great assortment so far this is just the first few and we will show more during the coming weeks so please keep sending us your amazing creations using the leapintothelight hashtag and tagging a destiny social media account leap of faithhunterthank you

winner with of the votes is design synthwavewe are always excited to see what the community votes for now please be a bit patient while the team implements the design on our beloved linear fusion rifle and thanks one more time to stellarstatelogic for their awesome work remembering and now a moment to reflect we are approaching the end of the year and we couldn't miss the opportunity to highlight some of our favorite moments of some things might seem small from the outside like changing the number of our patch notes rip or messing around with a weapon gone rogue others are as big as launching the official destiny tiktok account showcasing destiny 's next expansion or you know joining sony interactive entertainment but if we are honoring this whole year we have to start with you the destiny community the community managers at bungie always have a great time writing community focus articles we talked to content creators like gamergirlgrey artists like caseyroo cosplayers like lily bean and the list goes on and on so many beloved names out there it's hard to pick just a few getting to know their personal stories is a pivotal tool to better connect with the community during we have widened our reach with more international support and showcased some creators for countries like spain poland brazil and many other places and speaking of brazil we launched new social media channels in portuguese in october oba getting even closer to players all over the world is something we ll continue to work on in then there are the community artists not even a million words would equal the talents of our beloved creators of videos fan art and fashion statements you have examples of their genius in every twab so please keep sharing your amazing work on social media with the

she really is we also have very funny and ingenious ones like the ones we showed on the shreds of light costume contest feel free to create your own take on your favorite character we totally support it another way of honoring the community we set up was the random acts of kindness no matter how small you think a good deed might be it will always leave ripples in the destiny universe we intend to keep giving out a certain very special emblem to the nicest people in the community so don't stop being nice to each other and we even had some community gatherings the old way you know in person in october hundreds of guardians had an amazing time in melbourne australia during a community event where even savath n dropped by the very next month more than italian community members had an amazing day during the milan games week where emblems were given creators shared their views about the game and savath n was there as well isn't she lovely and tomorrow we will have another one in the united kingdom in london the tickets sold out just after minutes of going live thank you for your enthusiasm what else oh how about some amazing developer spotlights and tech blogs we are incredibly proud of the work bungie artists do and how they shape the way destiny looks and feels something that wouldn't be possible without engineers creating the code that makes everything work or storytellers that build the most intriguing lore and the most touching moments of every season and musicians and audio designers filling each room with touching melodies and unforgettable sound effects we love destiny as much as anyone else and we always aim to improve the player experience even if sometimes that means acknowledging what went wrong explaining what worked and what didn't with the launch of iron banner rift even if it left us in a very vulnerable place was totally worth it and finally bungie as a game studio has supported multiple charities through the bungie foundation in and we are committed as always to all the causes worth fighting for it's also a privilege to celebrate and honor dates like the national coming out day to support essential healthcare rights for everyone in the us to raise awareness on the conflicts around the world and to stand against hate destiny player support here's the lastest report from our amazing support team known issues list help forums bungie

subclassesgunslingerknock 'em downgolden gunnow provides bonus damage resistance to deadshot golden gun and no longer provides bonus duration no longer provides bonus damage resistance to marksman golden gun note after seeing this play out in the wild it was clear that there wasn't enough differentiation between deadshot and marksman golden gun primarily due to deadshot benefiting significantly more from knock 'em down's bonus duration as seen by the number of seventh eighth and fourteenth column videos in recent months we want to push these two enhanced supers further apart and solidify marksman golden gun as the option where you can take your time to aim your shot from range and deadshot as a more in-the-fray option we believed that doubling up on bonuses and the bonus duration was confusing these identities and not giving them enough space to breathe blade barrageblade barrage bonus projectiles reduced from to per group it now releases a total of knives from base down from note while it was refreshing to see blade barrage topping the charts as a change of pace the stacking bonuses from patch 's pve damage increase and consistency improvements and knock 'em down's bonus knives in combination with other buildcrafting elements pushed the burst damage of blade barrage above where we were comfortable with burst supers being we believe this will still be a strong option for burst damage without being as much of an outlier dawnbladecelestial fireincreased close-range melee damage from to so players using celestial fire and the auto-melee option are no longer

roaming duration from s to s decreased the bonus lifetime granted by spark of magnitude to the enhanced storm grenade from s to s fixed an issue that caused the enhanced storm grenade's effective area to be difficult to understand in pvp previously the friend-or-foe ring surrounding a touch of thunder storm grenade's lightning strikes blinked on and off between strikes and there was no indication within the cloud itself of whether or not it was friend or foe now the ring persists through the life of the storm and enemy storms have an additional vfx layer in the cloud itself to help

provided a tl dr at the start of that section if you re in a hurry i ll be honest with you we re trying to keep this twab under six thousand words spoiler alert we didn't it s always fun to have chonky blog articles but they can be a bit rough to trim on our weekly communications timeline sometimes there s just a lot of news if you want to carve out some time to deep dive this might end up being a minute read keep in mind we re taking next week off from our twab cycle for thanksgiving here in the states so after this read we won t be seeing you again in a twab until december trans awareness week before we dive into the gaming news we d like to give a spotlight to our trans bungie inclusion club this week is trans awareness week and they have some wonderful words on its importance and how profits from the bungie pride pin will be used to better our communities you can also find a code for our be true emblem below just in case you haven t redeemed it yet trans bungie in a time as tumultuous as the recent years it is especially important to remember that we stand alongside each other in times of strife that s why in this twab we d like to remind everyone about transgender awareness week starting november and ending on november for transgender day of remembrance we here at trans bungie and bungie as a whole support our transgender and gender nonconforming community and hope that you will join us in celebrating those who have come before those with us and those who will come after us may your lights continue to shine radiant and proud as all stars are part of the larger sky and the world would be darker without you as the celebration leads into the transgender day of remembrance we hope you ll join us in memorializing those in our community who we

transgender equality a wonderful source of information and support for both transgender and gender nonconforming community members and allies alike we also encourage you to see if there are ways to support your local community year-round community event improving the eliksni quarter since season of the splicer we ve been finding our new eliksni friends in some of the most unexpected places many corners of our tower have become safe havens for them even if they're struggling with vending machines a space in the last city was also carved out to serve as a home for them however we ve been noticing that the eliksni quarter is a bit cold while spider has set up a cozy little shop to house his business dealings many are still taking up residence in places without walls shelter or warmth misraaks is calling upon us to aid in improving their living environment starting next tuesday the eliksni quarter community event is beginning here s how you can help all guardians will be asked to collect treasure in the form of captain's coins from around the system to donate towards the eliksni quarter helping spider with improvements and upkeep while misraaks and eido devote their time to researching the relics of nezarec captain's coins can be found in destination chests lost sectors public events and of course season of plunder ketchcrash and expedition activities you can also find captain's coins in the king's fall raid dares of eternity strikes crucible and gambit each guardian will have their own personal donations reward track with an emblem upgrade materials and a new swashbuckling ghost shell the community as a whole will pool their treasure together to help misraaks and spider improve the eliksni quarter receiving global community earned rewards and special eliksni 'thank you' gifts along the way guardians may even find a deepsight weapon or two to help with completing their crafting collection the community event only lasts for two weeks so tell your friends assemble a fireteam and track down that treasure as the event progresses we re excited to see things shape up for our fallen friends stay tuned for updates on your progress comms are clear just in time for this little event we also have a quick message from our development team dealing with narrative voiceovers dev team due to some space pirate meddling the voiceover dialog in ketchcrash and expedition may not have accurately reflected a character's progress through the seasonal story we made those bugs walk the plank and now the correct lines will play for anyone who wants to jump back in for the community event or do some last-minute campaign completion before season drops scallywag title requirements update next tuesday we ll also have some changes coming to the season of plunder title specifically we ll be reducing some requirements to unlock scallywag we have some words from the development team to explain the changes dev team we've looked at the data and the season of plunder seal and title is harder to acquire than originally intended to earn the seal you will still need to complete the vast majority of plunder content and show mastery over the seasonal activities seals are meant to be an aspirational goal but our data shows that certain triumphs were over-tuned we're taking the feedback around destiny's grind to heart which is why we made the decision to deploy the following changes before the season concludes drop ruffian completion value to down from while we introduced a fix to prevent ruffians from despawning in expeditions players can still progress through objectives a bit too fast for these champions to spawn as such we re reducing the requirement to help players meet the requirements a bit faster drop vendor upgrades required down from this would be the equivalent of completing the first weeks of seasonal challenges that award repute the upgrade currency change promote and summon first mates to doing it time each we realize that this step didn t have a deep enough tutorial for some players to fully grasp and requires a lengthy grind to unlock all three first mates change the seal requirement to complete out of triumphs this should allow some flexibility for players as they progress through triumphs and seasonal challenges to unlock the seasonal title stay tuned to bungie help for further announcements game security update while we know you re hungry for crucible news we have one final update for you before we get to the goods earlier this week our security team made some changes to help protect our competitive crucible experience and more we re keeping the details a bit light for the sake of security but here s the update in their words security team the team is continuing to improve upon detections and mitigations gained with battleye with their help we have implemented a mitigation against network tools used to gain an unfair advantage in various activities we will continue to collect data and observe this behavior to strengthen our detections as time goes on competition is best when fair while we are evaluating this data we will continue to issue bans to those abusing these methods as always please leverage our in-game reporting tools or make a report right here on bungie net when encountering other players that you suspect may be cheating the crucible and the future today we ll be digging into what the crucible is for destiny philosophies behind things like quickplay and ranked will be explained and we ll be speaking about quite a few general changes we re making as part of our upkeep some of these sections will be dense others will be a breeze of bulleted lists and patch note previews if you re not into deep diving here s a quick bulleted summary for you tl dr we define our goals for the crucible ecosystem we re updating our crucible playlist structure to streamline our crucible offerings and help focus our crucible population collapsing control and clash into a single quickplay playlist bringing some of our lesser-played game modes into weekly rotators we re introducing a new crucible seal and bringing engram focusing to lord shaxx to give players more ways to engage with crucible rewards in lightfall we ll be expanding engram focusing to include older weapons and armor sets across crucible iron banner trials and more in season iron banner gets a new mode and a legacy armor set that veteran guardians should recognize we re updating our matchmaking techniques between skill connection and team sizes to provide better experiences in the crucible this starts with quickplay and will roll out to more playlists over time we re also tuning quitter suspension parameters for quickplay we re testing new matchmaking techniques in trials to hopefully provide better experience to solo and duo fireteams without the need for freelance this will also help us in reassessing the flawless pool for season and beyond we re bringing more maps to the crucible over the next year two maps are returning from the earlier years of destiny and a brand-new map is being added during the year of lightfall we re introducing competitive division to act as our ranked crucible space for players seeking to test their skill still here sweet the following changes have been developed by the team dedicated to destiny s ritual modes what started with our trials revamp many seasons ago has become a fun development cycle that now spans multiple rituals we ve been focusing on given activities gambit iron banner and now crucible during seasonal development to revisit and reset our goals and address player feedback for crucible there s quite a bit on the table and it s always a multi-part conversation in early december we ll have sandbox and balance information today we ll be talking about playlists modes and the places you play without further ado let s get to it player experience goalsdevelopment team as a part of our continuing evolution of destiny we like to revisit various aspects of the game to see how well they fit with the rest of the game to help give some context to changes we are making to the competitive ecosystem we would like to lay out our thoughts on the overall philosophy our player experience goals and how different aspects of the crucible fit together casual crucible - quickplay rotators labs find a fair game make friends and stay as long as you're having fun real life comparison pickup games at the gym iron banner week-long celebration of pvp in destiny that draws in everyone real life comparison exhibition play at a block party trials of osiris prove your skill and build against worthy rivals real life comparison high stakes pro-am tournaments ranked play fair matches measure yourself growth you can see and feel stakes are always high real life comparison local recreational leagues private match make the game you want play with your friends and stay as long as you're having fun real life comparison game night with friends with these definitions in mind let s get into the thick of it to help us achieve our goals we have numerous changes planned for season and beyond season playlist updateswe began our journey of crucible updates with a long look at what the current offerings are in destiny there are objective modes like control elimination-centric modes like clash and competitive modes like survival elimination or showdown when going through the experience and looking at back-end data we felt it would be best to streamline some of these offerings and help focus players on specific playlist offerings while meeting our player experience goals that were listed above starting in season the crucible screen will have the following options quickplay v this is now a playlist with both clash and control uses loose skill-based matchmaking sbmm which we have tuned during season weekly rotator v ffa rotates weekly between momentum control mayhem team scorched rift and rumble use purely connection-based matchmaking cbmm competitive division freelance v this is now a playlist randomly picking survival rift and showdown these modes showcase a variety of playstyles designed to show how good you really are uses a new sbmm setting built using concepts we developed for loose sbmm tuning but tightened to match you more closely against opponents of your skill crucible labs during season labs is showcasing v rift with asymmetric maps labs has a stacking reputation booster crucible labs uses cbmm private match this will continue to act as your place to train up in a given mode play against your friends host small tournaments or mess with activity settings to make silly modes the crucible screen will also update during limited-time pvp events trials of osiris v when trials is active it replaces crucible labs trials uses ticket-based matchmaking tbmm and the flawless pool though we have some news on that below too iron banner freelance v when iron banner is active it replaces the quickplay node iron banner is going to be moving to loose sbmm during season here's an example image of what the crucible director will look like during an iron banner week with rumble as the featured weekly rotator mode let s talk strategy and a bit about player populations we have a few analytics we like to look at to determine playlist health average daily and weekly concurrent players as well as weekly playtime-per-player in the playlists modeaverage populationplaytime-per-playeriron bannerhighhighcontrolhighmediumtrials of osirismediumhighsurvivalmediummediummayhemhighlowmomentumhighlowprivate matchmedium-lowmediumeliminationmedium-lowlowscorched varieslowclashvarieslowrumblelowlowshowdownlowlowkey takeaways to no surprise the champions of both number of daily weekly players and or playtime-per-player are iron banner control and trials of osiris glory survival gets a decent population and strong time per player rotators are a mixed bag momentum control and mayhem get lots of players the weeks they are active but don't come close to getting as much playtime as other offerings clash and scorched do better or worse depending on the season and weekly offerings finally we get to the always-on options elimination rumble and private match you would think since private match offers no extrinsic rewards drops bounties etc it would have the fewest players and the least playtime but you would be wrong very wrong with the findings above we ve decided to move some modes around we ve heard from players that they generally enjoy clash and would love to see it more often so we created the quickplay playlist to feature both control and clash to help focus player populations and invite more players to engage in the solo crucible combat of rumble we ll be moving this mode to our weekly rotator playlist a few times a season elimination will be unique to trials of osiris or private match if players would like to practice and showdown has been moved to the competitive division playlist to give some variety as players climb the new divisions as always we ll be monitoring the experience conversation and data as these refreshed playlists roll out nothing s set in stone and we re excited to see how these evolve over time crucible rewards starting in season players will have new triumphs and a new title to chase when creating this new title we had many goals centered around ways for players to express their crucible prowess slaying enemies capturing objectives and even climbing through some of the divisions of our new competitive division which we speak to in-depth towards the end of our crucible writeup say hello to glorious when it comes to gilding we ve taken a pass on the requirements for unbroken to relieve stress win streaks and reaching specific glory thresholds over multiple seasons are no longer required we will be challenging you to win a number of matches during a given season and reach the adept division more on that below for gilding but all of this can be accomplished within a single season if you see someone with a gilded glorious you know they are the best of the best lord shaxx engram focusing starting in season lord shaxx will offer the ability for players to focus crucible weapons and armor crucible will be the fourth of the core rituals after trials of osiris gambit and iron banner to get comprehensive engram focusing options helping players target specific pieces of gear they ve been hunting crucible engrams crucible engrams will be a virtual currency and live exclusively on the rank progress bar on lord shaxx crucible engrams may be opened individually by players directly on shaxx crucible gear focusing you can focus the crucible engram directly into either crucible armor or crucible weapons crucible gear focusing cost for season crucible engram glimmer legendary shards crucible engrams do not need to be claimed in order to be spent on focusing see note below individual pieces of gear must have been acquired at least once prior to being available for focusing crucible armor available for focusing in season clutch extol set crucible weapons available for focusing in season stars in shadow the keening frozen orbit survivor s epitaph sorrow s verse crisis inverted riptide out of bounds brand new crucible weapons are only available as drops during their introductory season and are then available for focusing the following season other shaxx changes the kill-tracker ghost shell will no longer appear at lord shaxx if it has already been acquired it may be reacquired from collections note shaxx is using a new engram system that lets us use the engram stored directly on the vendor for focusing rather than needing to pull it into your engram inventory making this change is more convenient for you and lets us more easily shift the main cost burden from lots of legendary shards and glimmer to multiple engrams while the current costs are similar to gambit's expect a larger focusing rebalancing pass read lower glimmer and legendary shard costs with lightfall as well as all of the ritual vendors converted over into this new system a wallet item showing you all of the various engram counts will be available in season additionally we ll be looking at ways for players to earn older crucible armor sets through focusing in season when lightfall releases we ve previously announced legacy focusing for trials nightfall and iron banner and this applies to armor sets as well if you ve been asking for the return of the exile armor set or eyeballing some older iron banner pieces we re looking forward to having those available once more stay tuned for more details introducing iron banner fortressback in season of the haunted saladin re-established the iron banner as the twice-a-season pvp celebration for everyone guardians from all around wear their flaming iron banner armor and compete for the love of competition since then we have brought rift into destiny and introduced our first new mode since team scorched iron banner eruption we want to continue this tradition of introducing unique spins on existing modes for season let us introduce you to iron banner fortress in iron banner fortress the core gameplay is capturing and holding zones if that sounds like zone control to you you'd be right the real fun begins when caiatl gets involved but we ll leave some of this for you to experience first-hand when iron banner fortress launches on january let s just say a few of you may be dying to cap a hill iron banner rewards in season players can expect to earn a few returning iron banner weapons not seen since the earlier days of destiny if auto rifles or slug shotguns are your thing saladin has something special for you updated with random rolls fresh perks from the last few seasons and the iron banner origin trait we re looking forward to seeing what rolls you chase that s not all it s been about a year since our last iron banner armor refresh we ve seen some wonderful themes throughout the years inspirations drawn from ages past focused on the looks of a true warrior this year we ll be returning to some fan favorite sets coming from an era of a taken king we re expecting these to be a fun complement to many sets in the game and looking forward to your fashion statements coming out of iron banner next season new matchmaking techniques fireteam-based matchmaking starting in the first week of season we will be testing a new quickplay matchmaking parameter that should excite many of you fireteam-based matchmaking fbmm at a high concept fbmm means that your fireteam s makeup should match your opponents if you join a matchmaking queue as a full team of six you should generally match against another full fireteam depending on how long you wait in matchmaking it might start a match against fireteam of five plus a solo if you wait longer you might start against a fireteam of four plus a duo or two solos if you are a smaller fireteam you might match with a larger fireteam against two fireteams of similar sizes or against all smaller fireteams as with all of our other matchmaking parameters as explained in the season twab fbmm can be as loose or strict as we want for quickplay we will be fairly generous allowing slightly mismatched fireteams if skill is similar and connections are fast once we have ample time to test these matchmaking settings we re planning to roll them out to more playlists iron banner trials of osiris and more as next season starts just before a holiday period we ll be taking a bit of time to make sure things are solid expect more news and updates in january improving connection at the high end over the last season we ve been monitoring and adjusting loose sbmm settings that were applied to quickplay while we re seeing better matches for many players we re also seeing issues with player connections when getting into higher skill bands to address this we are planning to roll out a second new matchmaking feature yes our programmers and tech designers have been busy called dynamic skill ranges at a high level this feature increases the skill window our system looks for when matchmaking if you are in a low population skill bracket or during a particularly low population time e g am pacific when many are sleeping or just waking up the intention here is to increase the window enough to give those playing at low population times additional good connections to choose from without harming the skill balance significantly this is the next step in our evolution of loose sbmm that we introduced in season due to timing holidays we hope to roll out dynamic skill ranges sometime in january but we expect it to significantly increase connection qualities in matches for the high-skill players in control we don't want to set a firm date just yet our plans will change as we tune fbmm but we will have more information as we get closer to pushing this live quitter suspensions during season s rollout of sbmm we applied a competitive quitter penalty to the quickplay playlist to help ensure that all skill brackets were getting fair and complete matches though it was done as an emergency measure we eventually made it so that quickplay had its own quitter-tracking system and didn t share the one we used with competitive and trials for season we've made the following changes lowered the amount of suspension time handed out for serial quitting in the quickplay playlist added the amount of time remaining to all suspension messages and made the messages trigger when clicking on the node if you want to know how much time you have left before you can play again the information is now available as we continue to roll out both of the new matchmaking techniques fbmm and dynamic skill ranges which address many of the player feedback surrounding sbmm in quickplay we will be re-evaluating the need for a quitter penalty in quickplay at all as always we enjoy being transparent about our matchmaking changes expect notifications from our awesome support and community teams on various social channels when and if we make updates to matchmaking for any node trials of osiris while season has much of its focus on general crucible playlists matchmaking and the introduction of competitive division we do have some upkeep planned for trials of osiris for starters we re following tradition with two new weapon rewards for players to hunt for whether you are hungry for a base model or the fabled adept variant we have a new machine gun and hand cannon up for grabs this is where i'd show you an example image of the saint- vendor screen but we don't want to spoil any gear icon watermarks for the new season just yet additionally we re looking to add fbmm into trials of osiris in the future by introducing these matchmaking changes to the playlist we re looking to provide a larger sense of fairness for smaller fireteams and eliminate the need for a freelance node solos can match solos or fill in for teams of duos fireteams of three will match fireteams of three while we won t have changes to the flawless pool for season we are working on a new paradigm that removes the flawless pool but still provides protection for players working on trials reputation rewards expect more information later in season as our goal is to have a trials labs during season for the year of lightfall maps this past year we saw the return of two destiny maps eternity vostok one map from destiny cathedral of dusk and a brand-new map set on savath n s throne world disjunction much of our focus for this year of map content was to give players some larger spaces lanes for sniping and a bit of range for pulse rifles scouts and other ranged options for the coming year we are going to be bringing back two more maps from earlier in destiny and we ve just started production on a brand-new map which we expect to be released in the year of lightfall if you have some experience creating gameplay spaces and would like to join us in creating destiny content be sure to check out our careers page specifically keep an eye out for world art listings in the future competitive division after the changes to trials of osiris gambit and iron banner the last few seasons we knew we had to look at our ranked play experience next while the glory playlist had been home to our core v skill-based offering for years it had fallen behind in the rewards department since we sunset the pinnacle weapons and their quests in beyond light additionally it was built onto a hybrid skill persistence model to enable more players to get to the top ranks than you would normally expect on a bell curve we knew we had to revisit the reward structure as well as fit the ranking system to more closely reflect player skill we also wanted to create something that would be familiar to players of other competitive games in multiple genres while adding our own flair goals for competitive division all players can find a variety of balanced matches and feel competitive a player s pvp division is a core part of their guardian identity maintain places in the ecosystem to not engage in ranked play but still have decently balanced matches or to not engage in skill-based matching at all what is competitive division in season we are removing glory and adding a v ranked playlist competitive division which is a true ladder-based system there are seven divisions each with three subdivisions copper bronze silver gold platinum adept ascendantour goal is to provide players with ladders to climb and divisions to achieve giving a more accurate representation of skill than our current glory system players who surpass gold and begin to chip away at platinum adept and ascendant will represent some of the best crucible players that our community has to offer let s talk a bit about how you climb the ladder this is a higher-level explanation of how things work we ll be releasing a help article closer to launch to go a bit further in-depth at the start of the season you will begin a placement series during which you will not gain any division rating for the first seven games after the seventh game you complete the placement series and are placed into a division based on skill for the first season the highest you can be placed is gold iii in future seasons you will be placed closer to your previous competitive division as you continue to compete in the competitive division your division rating is adjusted based on four major factors match outcome whether you win or lose division inflation deflation how far above or below your division is compared to your skill match performance how well you performed on a match-to-match basis player-to-lobby skill delta how your skill compares to everyone else in the match as you earn and lose division rating if you gain enough rating to move up between subdivisions ex from gold ii to gold i you automatically enter the next subdivision same goes for moving down subdivisions if you gain enough rating to move up a division ex from gold i to platinum iii you enter a promotion series where you must win two out of three games to be promoted to the next division similarly if you lose enough rating to move down a division ex from gold iii to silver you enter a relegation series where you must win two out of three games to remain in your current division upon reaching gold or higher your division rating is subject to decay on a weekly basis i e you will lose division rating if you haven't played enough matches recently also we will have a small intro quest that will demonstrate the competitive division system and unlock a reward listed later in this twab this quest must be completed once for each account and will be available from shaxx once you unlock crucible as a new light or immediately for veteran players competitive division rewards since competitive division is aimed at drawing a close link between skill and division we don't see division as something to really grind for rewards we don't want someone to feel pressure to play tons of games looking for a drop all while your division rating drops and you ruin your division standing instead we want the primary motivator to be your actual division we aren't going to be adding any unique grindable rewards outside of those you can get anywhere in crucible and really focus our rewards on weekly participation and achieving higher divisions secondly we are going to be very careful about giving out high-performance rewards for achieving higher divisions since these divisions are tightly tied to skill some divisions will be completely unattainable to some players no matter how much they try play having some of the old pinnacle weapons tied to higher glory had some unfortunate effects on players and led us to eventually add numerous persistence features to the ranking system to avoid that we are going to initially keep rewards for achieving a higher division limited to efficiency rewards your current division gives you a multiplier on all crucible ranks reputation earned in destiny letting you earn more crucible engrams resets and extra perks on weapons much faster copper and bronze - x silver - x gold - x platinum - x adept - x ascendant - x so even if you aren't great at pvp jumping into competitive division and earning keeping your rank up will help you earn crucible rewards - faster than now this bonus stacks multiplicatively with both the scheduled bonus ranks weeks and the hidden bonus in crucible labs as a note we are reducing bonus week crucible rank multipliers from to in season our goal in the above changes is to reduce the need to wait for bonus ranks weeks to get the most out of your crucible playtime with the added bonuses provided by divisions of players will be earning more reputation over the course of the season than what s currently available we ll be keeping a close eye on this change to ensure there isn t any major negative impact on the rewards that players are earning we have also moved unique glory playlist rewards mida multi-tool catalyst is now a rare drop on any win in the crucible one of the best rewards you can get from competitive division is right in the name your competitive division which you have earned throughout the season lets you know where you actually sit in the hierarchy of players better than kda win percentage or a third-party elo ranking ever could every thorn has a rose for our weekly participation rewards mentioned above we are bringing an old favorite back that's right rose is back for competitive division rose was originally a legendary hand cannon earned during the lumina exotic quest it has a long history in destiny in which it was corrupted then redeemed it now returns with random rolls and an updated perk pool hybrid fires like a rpm hand cannon but allows you to move like a rpm and has stats that blend the two its perk list is built from popular consistency perks designed to highlight v play random rolled grips instead of an origin trait how do you earn it though when you complete your competitive division intro quest once per character you get a drop with the perk selection rose originally had after the intro quest you have a character-based weekly competitive division challenge to earn another roll that's it play competitive division earn one roll a week per character future rewards updates we aren't done here in the seasons post-lightfall we are expecting to get further cosmetic rewards for competitive division we are still working out the details of what you can earn when you can start earning them and how you earn them expect more discussion after lightfall launches and with that we come to the end of our crucible update preview we have a little bit of something for everyone and maybe even a lot of something for everyone no doubt there are some thoughts and feelings being shared among your discord servers and texts to friends already but we ll be watching the conversation as all of these changes roll out player support

continue looking over feedback surrounding loose sbmm throughout the season twitch drop emblem clarification we have seen reports of confusion about how to claim the twitch drop reward the starbirth emblem to clarify an issue we re investigating the partners rewards page should only show the emblem not the claim button the claim button doesn't do anything and will be removed if the emblem shows up on your partner rewards page then you own the emblem it may take a while seemingly several hours for it to appear in your in-game collections due to a queue but it will eventually appear under flair emblems general if the emblem doesn't show up on the partner rewards page press the refresh button beside missing twitch rewards if it still doesn't appear click this page and confirm that the emblem appears if it does then you qualified for it and just need to connect your twitch account to your bungie net account acquiring umbral energy from the season pass players who own the season

we continue investigating various known issues here is a list of the latest issues that were reported to us in our help forum the quicksilver storm exotic auto rifle has no weapon icon when equipped

objective may not successfully progress on ketchcrash activity completion players with a full quest inventory will be unable to successfully pick up the captain's atlas during the seasonal intro this can be resolved by clearing quest inventory space and acquiring it from the postmaster players may be blocked from seasonal progress if they return to orbit too quickly after completing the boss encounter of the seasonal intro mission this can be resolved by players completing the mission again without returning to orbit on another character plundered umbral energy cannot be claimed from the

will deal reduced damage per bullet decrease collective obligation increased void leech timer to seconds in pve activities pvp remains at seconds removed the void leech cooldown add a damage bonus against pve combatants only while void leech is active takes less hits to fully charge void leech kills against debuffed targets instantly charge void leech void leech is also instantly charged when your character is affected by void debuffs does not work if hitting yourself with your own suppressor grenade fixed an issue where umbral sustenance was activating with non-void overshields abilities arc subclasses reworked to fit the subclass system there are too many individual systemic changes to list here but the arc subclasses now use the aspect and fragment system used by stasis void and solar standardized a set of buffs and debuffs aligned to the arc damage type amplified - your movement speed and weapon handling are greatly increased after sprinting for a short time you enter speed booster further increasing your sprint speed and granting damage resistance against pve combatants by default rapidly defeating multiple targets with arc damage will amplify you your equipped aspects and fragments provide additional methods to become and benefit from being amplified ionic trace - a bolt of pure arc energy that travels along the ground seeking its creator when picked up ionic traces grant grenade melee and class ability energy blind - combatants are disoriented and cannot fire their weapons enemy players' hud is removed and their vision is obscured jolted - the target is energized with destructive arc light as they take additional damage while jolted they chain lightning to nearby enemies this chain lightning can occur multiple times while a target is jolted hovering over aspects fragments or abilities on the arc subclass screen now displays a tooltip flyout detailing any relevant status effects some old subclass perks have been deprecated while others have been rolled into base ability behavior fragments or aspects with some changes to behavior as a result all classes now have access to all arc grenades grenades storm grenade total damage across the two detonations reduced from to improved damage area consistency under certain network conditions to fix an issue where it was dealing delayed damage base cooldown increased from s to s lightning grenade damage per strike reduced from to arcbolt grenade damage reduced from to base cooldown reduced from s to s skip grenade base cooldown increased from s to s flashbang grenade blind duration decreased from seconds to seconds vs players pulse grenade base cooldown increased from s to s vortex grenade fixed an issue causing this to deal less damage than intended against pve targets hunter arcstrider arc staff now has both whirlwind guard block capability and lightning reflexes armored dodge as default behavior arc staff damage vs minor and elite combatants increased by new super added gathering stormhurl your arc staff forward embedding it into surfaces or large targets dealing damage to and jolting nearby targets after a short time a devastating lightning bolt strikes the staff overcharging it with arc energy while overcharged your staff discharges lightning at nearby foes new jump added blink arc hunters have recovered from a not-so-brief case of amnesia causing them to forget how to blink disorienting blow now applies a short blind to nearby targets rather than a generic disorient and also amplifies you on hit combination blow now also recharges your class ability when you successfully defeat a target with this charged melee in addition to increasing your charged melee damage base cooldown increased from s to s tempest strike increased travel distance from m to m added a small amount of initial tracking to help tempest strike land on close targets now jolts targets on hit base damage decreased from to lethal current reworked after dodging your next melee attack has increased range jolts the struck target and leaves behind a damaging aftershock damaging a jolted target with melee attacks also blinds them while using arc staff your next attack strikes twice after dodging deprecated the ebb and flow subclass node perk nightstalker spectral blades spectral blades damage vs minor and elite combatants increased by titan striker fists of havoc now has terminal velocity's slam bonus as default behavior the slam's bonus damage when activated from the air is now constant rather than variable based on your height when you activate the slam light attack energy cost normalized between previous top and bottom tree cost at previously heavy slam radius normalized between the previous top and bottom tree cost at meters previously m m fists of havoc damage vs champion miniboss and boss combatants increased by damage vs minor and elite combatants increased by note previously fists of havoc relied on knockout bonus damage and trample energy refunds to consistently deal with standard combatants in pve we'd like this to be better able to stand on its own now to partially compensate for the increased attack energy costs new class ability added thruster activate while grounded to perform a quick first-person lateral evade new melee ability added thunderclap hold melee while grounded to plant your feet and begin charging your fist with arc energy release melee to punch forward unleashing a large blast of force that deals additional damage the longer the melee button was held seismic strike blind duration decreased from seconds to seconds vs players now while amplified the blinding radius is increased from m to m and the blind duration is increased to seconds vs players ballistic slam fixed an issue where the ballistic slam camera could sometimes cause you to dive straight down rather than at your aimed location no longer applies inertia override on hit knockout defeating targets with melee attacks now also amplifies you in addition to starting your health regeneration knockout is no longer consumed on your next melee kill instead knockout lasts for a set seconds after which it needs to be reactivated by breaking a combatant shield or critically wounding a target deprecated the frontal assault melee ability and the aftershocks and trample subclass node perks sentinel sentinel shield sentinel shield damage vs minor and elite combatants increased by warlock stormcaller stormtrance now has ionic blink and landfall as default behaviors landfall seeker damage reduced from to note while the seekers added to bottom tree stormcaller in season of the lost were a lot of fun they made stormtrance more of a shutdown super than we're comfortable with given that it is also a solid roaming option and now has increased base mobility with ionic blink we felt we could reduce the seekers damage stormtrance no longer increases its attack upkeep cost when targeting multiple enemies at once note we believe that stormtrance's greatest strength should be clearing hordes of enemies and the increased cost based on target count was running counter to that intended role stormtrance damage vs minor and elite combatants increased by chain lightning while amplified chain lightning now creates two sets of chains up from one jumping between more targets now also jolts your primary target lunge range increased from m to m ball lightning while amplified ball lightning now detonates two additional times for a total of three vertical damaging strikes increased arming shape length below the projectile by meters to resolve some edge cases where targets that the detonation area could potentially damage were not triggering the projectile to detonate arc souls being or becoming amplified now also amplifies your arc souls granting them a greatly increased fire rate damage per projectile increased from to vs pve combatants amplified arc souls projectiles per burst decreased from to fire rate decreased by note we expect to see significantly increased uptime on supercharged arc souls so we wanted to provide a bit more time between bursts where players could safely engage an enemy that has an arc soul in pvp activities we hope the increased pve damage offsets this change sufficiently but we ll be keeping an eye on it going forward deprecated the rising storm melee ability along with the transcendence pulsewave and arc web subclass node perks arc aspects hunter flow state tempest strike lethal current titan touch of thunder juggernaut knockout warlock arc soul lightning surge electrostatic mind arc fragments spark of beacons spark of resistance spark of momentum spark of shock spark of discharge spark of frequency spark of focus spark of recharge spark of voltage spark of magnitude general blink maximum displacement distance increased from m to m maximum vertical offset how high up or down you are displaced based on your aim angle from the horizon increased from m to m increased forgiveness of mantling to ledges after exiting blink energy model reworked previously blink charges recharged slowly one-by-one and could be activated at a cadence that felt inconsistent and often left players confused as to how many charges they had available now blink has a consistent activation cost you can carry two charges at once and seconds after activating your last blink both are immediately recharged we've also added a screen wipe and sound effect when this occurs similar to icarus dash to help communicate when you're ready to blink again the overall availability of blink is similar to the previous version but we hope it is more understandable and results in fewer instances of frustration from the energy recharge model note these changes apply to blink on all subclasses that have access to it blind screen shader brightness has been significantly decreased to address photosensitivity issues from the previous fully whited-out version ionic traces no longer provide super energy on pickup reduced melee grenade and class ability energy return to compensate for expected increased uptime base melee energy return reduced from to base grenade energy return reduced from to base class ability energy return reduced from to restoration fixed an issue where restoration x could be removed by some pve combatants' attacks and certain debuffs like overload rounds arc-focused exotic armor updates crown of tempests conduction tines now also activate from defeating targets with jolt damage getaway artist now amplifies you in addition to granting an arc soul when consuming your grenade platform and systems fixed an issue on playstation platforms where the text in many areas of the game would display an extra line break general fixed an issue where text chat messages persist

depending on the weapon archetype for a complete breakdown check out our massive novel-length twab from a previous week here for the full changes made to how airborne gameplay works please check out the full breakdown here for a brief recap at airborne effectiveness all primary weapons have their airborne accuracy penalty removed i e they're just as accurate airborne as grounded note corrected on we've added a new weapon stat called airborne effectiveness which has been deliberately tuned on all exotic weapons everything that shipped in season and everything from season onwards some outliers also have a hand-tuned stat like the rest of the trials of osiris and nightfall weapons all other weapons have a default value set per weapon archetype precision angle threshold - at stat high at stat this controls how easy it is to get headshots while airborne if this is you must pinpoint aim exactly at the head to get the headshot otherwise you'll get a body shot even if your aim assist cone overlaps with the head what this means overall is that players will get fewer misses due to randomness from the accuracy cone while airborne but reliance on aiming is much higher at low stat in order to make this easier players will need to build into airborne the airborne effectiveness stat comes from three sources weapon the weapon's base airborne effectiveness stat with ranges varying from to and to to depending on the weapon archetype exotic weapons typically get a higher stat than legendary weapons in that archetype this is available to weapon perks starting with air assault subclass the heat rises warlock solar aspect while heat rises is active i e on consuming your grenade the tempered metal solar fragment the whisper of hedrons stasis fragment exotic armor exotic armor that revolves around being airborne or works on specific weapons grants a bonus or penalty that is usually in the - to range foetracer to all mechaneer's tricksleeves to sidearms oathkeeper to bows sealed

of sacred dawn to all when aiming down sights while airborne when a solar subclass is equipped list updated to be correct on this means that in general if you want good airborne effectiveness i e stat you should pick a weapon with a high stat put icarus grip on it and either equip an exotic armor piece that helps or run a subclass aspect or fragment if you want the best possible airborne effectiveness you'll generally have to go all in on all three weapon exotic armor and subclass this is a big weapon system change we'll be monitoring how it rolls out and adjusting as needed playlist weapons gambit crucible and strike drops now have a chance to roll with extra traits in one or both columns increasing with number of rank resets with that vendor starting in season all playlist

seconds of invisibility up from with update we made a change to radar behavior for invisible targets we believe that this was the right path forward but our tuning was slightly too aggressive and removed space in the nightstalker kit that allowed them to intelligently flank bunkered players the changes in this update mean that base vanishing step or trapper s ambush melee invisibility will not trigger a second radar ping unless the invisible player begins sprinting or uses their vertical movement mode with one source of invisibility extension like echo of persistence or graviton forfeit active or with an extended invisibility effect like a trapper's ambush quickfall or stylish executioner activation one additional radar ping will occur and if two extensions are used then two additional radar pings will occur void volatile fixed an issue where volatile detonations could be applied to a single target immediately rather than going on the intended -second cooldown we don t

heard pin on the bungie store will be donated to the southern poverty law center for at least one year can be found here bungie statement on the terrorist attack in buffalo ny this week at bungie guardian games is coming to a close and we re but days away from a new season that s right guardian games is nearing its end warlocks are dominating as of this writing will they hold on for their first guardian games victory only time will tell actually not true our social media channels will also tell and you might be able to do the math by visiting the podium in the tower as they might have such a commanding lead that titans and hunters couldn t possibly catch up to their space magic we re just a few days out from a new season we ve covered quite a few systematic changes coming to destiny sandbox changes ritual reputation changes and a few other details on how gameplay in general will be updated many of you and when i say many i mean almost every single one of you have been asking about the new stuff what is season of redacted all about what s the next challenge our guardians are about to face what s going on with redacted and their redacted where s the trailer which subclass is getting the treatment there will be a day where many of your questions will be answered but today is not that day it s a scary but fun balancing act in the grand scheme of things i ve said it before but player discovery is one of the most potent things in gaming do we spill the details in twabs and tweets or do we hold things a bit closer to the chest with each season to let players dig in on day-one and find out some cool things in the game itself if you d like to go dark this should be one of the last bungie communications you read before tuesday at am pacific if you d like to get a quick taste before launch tune in a bit earlier on tuesday morning and keep an eye out for a countdown for our next trailer so what will be our final twab before launch we ve got some details on how seasonal events will be evolving a quick spoiler free patch note preview a rundown on when our next dungeon is going live and a preview of upcoming trials of osiris armor sets keep an eye out for our player support section too as we ll be breaking down the timelines for destiny update which kicks off season of redacted on tuesday destiny event updates once a season guardians get the chance to take a break from our galaxy-saving duties to relax and reflect in special annual celebrations these themed events which include guardian games solstice festival of the lost and the dawning have become an integral part of the annual flow of destiny where players can celebrate together and collect cool rewards along the way over the past year the team has been working hard on giving many of these events a makeover this effort began with last year s festival of the lost which featured new twists like the monsters vs dinos community poll and glint s ghost stories our goal is that every event provides joy and discovery for new and veteran players and the enthusiastic reaction to the festival of the lost reaffirmed our plans to keep evolving our events to keep them fresh and fun while not every event will get a big update this year we wanted to share a high-level look at our plans for the upcoming solstice event which begins on july solstice just solstice that s right we dropped the of heroes from the name of our summer event and are just going with solstice while we ve got a new name and will have some beautiful new floral arrangements adorning the tower during the event those familiar with solstice events from the past should still feel right at home as in previous years there will be an awesome set of armor to pursue only this time instead of completing armor objectives and collecting keys and packages consumables you ll be completing event challenges more on those in a bit to make progress towards your ultimate glowing masterpiece of bodily protection one of the biggest changes you ll notice with solstice is we ve changed the armor experience a lot players will only upgrade one set of solstice armor throughout the event while you can get multiple instances of a helmet for example upgrading armor will allow you to reroll its stats and the stat potential of the armor will be shared across those drops another new feature coming to solstice is an activity in the european aerial zone called bonfire bash where guardians will be building and stoking what can only be described as paracausal bonfires while the enemies of summer fun including the taken cabal hive and fallen will be attempting to crash the party and extinguish the fires in your mission to guard the flames from wave after wave of incoming enemies we ve made it easier to transverse the eaz adding floating islands and removing building-barriers for maximum maneuverability look for more details on solstice armor upgrades and bonfire bash as we get closer to the launch of solstice introducing the event card with our solstice event we re introducing a new feature called the event card in much the same way that seasonal challenges introduces an easy-to-understand and find list of goals you can complete in a season the event card does the same for destiny s annual events when solstice begins players will gain access to this event card which includes new points of interest to explore including event challenges event seals and titles unique event rewards every event card will be available for free to all players and can be accessed by interacting with eva levante in the tower or via the quests tab right next to seasonal challenges event cards and their associated challenges and rewards can be accessed for the entire event before disappearing once their corresponding event ends let s take a look at some of the individual parts of the event card in order to better understand how they tie into events overall event challenges like seasonal challenges event challenges are objectives that players can complete to earn rewards certain event challenges will award players with familiar items such as event shaders emblems or other gear and they ll also grant event tickets every event challenge will be available for players to complete right when the event starts so you won t need to wait until the next week for additional challenges to become available event challenges can be completed in any order and at any point while an event is active event seals and titles in addition to event challenges we re also going to be introducing event seals and titles that you can earn there are two types of event-based seals that players can work towards individual event seals a new multi-event seal starting with solstice this year each destiny event will come with a seal that players can complete as well as gild completing these event seals is as simple as completing all the event challenges on its event card finishing every event challenge will automatically earn you seal progress and unlock the title for that seal gilding event seals will require completing additional triumphs that will only become available once the standard seal has been completed gilding lasts until the event begins again the following year progress on individual event seals can be tracked directly in the event card by hovering over the card on the left-hand side of the screen or by viewing the event seal from the triumphs page there s also a new multi-event seal that event-loving players will be able to work toward starting with solstice players can complete a certain number of event challenges in each of the four yearly destiny events to complete this seal this means that the earliest players can complete the multi-event seal will be in guardian games of next year and doing so will also earn them a unique event title you ll also be able to gild this new seal after completing the standard version and we ll be sharing more details on how to do this in the coming year upgraded event card rewards a new event means new event-themed cosmetics for guardians to customize their experience while those items have traditionally been part of the eververse store with the upcoming solstice event we will curate a collection of these items as unique rewards through the event card itself these rewards will only be available through the event card during their initial release but like most of our cosmetics there s always a chance they ll become available again via eververse at a future date while the event card and event challenge rewards are free for all players acquiring these extra cosmetic rewards will require players to purchase the upgraded event card upgrading the event card will cost silver and immediately grants players an exotic reward bundle players can then acquire even more rewards by spending the event tickets they collect from event challenges the overall value of the upgraded event card will vary somewhat but is expected to regularly exceed silver description type instant unlock event tickets hot dog eating champ exotic emote instant sunny exotic ghost shell exotic ghost shell instant iris gossamer legendary shader instant skateboarding emote legendary emote tickets tbd legendary ghost hologram tickets tbd exotic ship tickets tbd legendary ghost hologram tickets tbd legendary transmat fx tickets hint if you aren t sure whether you will complete the event wait until the last week to make the purchase and see how many event tickets you have accumulated but don t wait until the very last minute because event tickets will expire once an event ends and the event card goes away we can t wait for everyone to jump in and experience all the new solstice changes we have in store see you in july another patch note preview while we

unstoppable the synaptic spear expertly crafted by hasfoundry pic twitter com ho ltajp destiny destinythegame may because this is destiny and we love our lore here s a special snippet from our narrative team about the history attached to this spear guardian my psions toiled to affix the ruins of ghaul s light-suppressing device to a weapon frame a war axe would be too heavy for weak human arms a maul lacked the resonance to pierce the psionic sphere finally i held the synaptic spear in my hands untested i frowned it was meant to be wielded by a lightbearer in the mindscape where their power would change it into a gleaming beacon even savath n would shield her eyes from its glare they told me i listened to their claims before taking the weapon for myself they raised their voices in protest but i silenced them with a look on the far shores of sorrow s harbor i waded into the hordes of ravening hive though the dull metals of the spear would not speak to me i still made it sing i may not have the light but i have strength empress caiatl the anticipation well that s a wrap your final twab before season of redacted ships now all that s left is a weekend of freelance zone capture

purchase a guardian games medal words was not enough for master rahool twab before last was a mega ultra-chonker even with thousands of words on the weapon changes coming in season questions still remain the team has been reading through the responses online and wanted to answer a few questions as well as clear up a few bits of confusion global flinch resistance how does flinch resistance work flinch resistance directly scales the angle your aim moves by when you take damage so if you have flinch resistance and you would normally be flinched degrees you would now be flinched degrees the flinch calculations show unflinching hand cannon mod and unflinching pulse rifle mods both total a x flinch multiplier was this a typo yes this was a typo sorry about that we fixed it what is a scalar when we say scalar we mean a multiplier e g a x scalar on flinch will multiply flinch by what are the scalars for some common flinch resistance sources no distractions x suros synergy x x unflinching armor mod x x unflinching armor mod x i e this value is used instead of multiplying two unflinching mod values together rally barricade x resilience x stability on an auto rifle x stability on a sniper rifle x given the importance of stability for flinch resistance do you plan to adjust the stability stats for any weapons we may adjust stability on specific weapons if we see clear outliers in the future airborne effectiveness can an airborne effectiveness penalty take you below in the stat no airborne effectiveness stat cannot go below or above the same is true of all weapon and character stats the tiers in the mega-twab were just general examples of performance within ranges every point in a weapon stat will count although a single point won't typically be perceptible in most cases there is a linear progression from to stat an exception being accuracy penalty angle on primary weapons which is linear from to but is flat from to how does airborne effectiveness interact with accuracy perks technically accuracy perks like opening shot apply to your airborne accuracy cone as before but because accuracy while airborne is generally better than it was before you'll feel the benefits a little less can you clarify precision aim assist when grounded and aiming down sights the full aim assist cone angle is used to determine whether a shot is a crit or a body shot when airborne or hip-firing by default you only get a crit if you're aimed exactly at the head while airborne the airborne effectiveness stat grants you some forgiveness for this in the form of the precision aim cone we have a graphic to help illustrate all of this key grounded crit your aim assist cone overlaps the head but you're not aimed right at it you get a crit airborne stat body shot your aim assist cone overlaps the head but the center of your reticle is not on the head you get a body shot airborne stat body shot your aim assist cone overlaps the head your precision aim cone does not overlap the head you get a body shot airborne stat crit your aim assist cone overlaps the head your precision aim cone overlaps the head you get a crit aim-assist cone blue circle center-point white dot precision-aim cone red circle can you give more details on how aim assist is affected while airborne the term aim assist has two parts auto-aim aka bullet bending bullet magnetism angle if a target falls inside this cone your projectile will aim at the target before the effects of the accuracy cone this applies equally to mouse and keyboard and controller reticle friction and adhesion friction slows down your aim when a target is within this cone and adhesion can pull your aim to stay on the target if they move while you're aiming this is only turned on for controller in the live game both angles are halved while airborne in season these cones are still halved as before and have an additional penalty angle that's subtracted from this depending on the airborne effectiveness stat here are some numbers stat auto-aim angle penalty is roughly half of the cone angle friction adhesion angle penalty is roughly a quarter of the cone angle in internal playtests we found that controller players were more affected by this penalty and halved it stat both cones angle penalty is i e at the auto-aim and friction cones for most weapons will be the same as they are in the live game scavenger perk changes are all scavenger mods disabled in pvp or only special weapon scavenger mods all are disabled with disabling ammo scavenger mods in pvp are you trying to bring back the double primary meta no we do want running double primaries to be more viable and want there to be fewer one-hit kills in pvp but don't want to eliminate them entirely you still spawn with two rounds of special ammo or equivalent and still pick up ammo bricks but you shouldn't be able to use a special weapon like a primary one interesting side effect may be an indirect buff to the strategy of running double primary to starve your opponents of special ammo drops are the special ammo weapon effectiveness and ammo changes enough to reduce their dominance in pvp short-range primary weapons will have more of a role now sidearms and smgs can better compete with shotguns for example we've pushed the current pvp ammo system as far as we can with this change if this doesn't move the needle we'll look at redesigning pvp ammo economy entirely which would be a longer-term change with scavenger mods disabled in pvp there's little competition for leg mod slots what's the plan we're keeping this in mind for future updates but for now we recommend you run holster mods other changes will playlist weapons that have a foundry get both the foundry and playlist origin perks yes new drops of playlist weapons that are from a foundry will get the playlist and the foundry perks what do the changes to snapshot sights mean snapshot sights works by multiplying the aim down sights ads animation duration by which you could frame as making it twice as fast on special weapons it will now scale this duration by making it faster instead note that we framed this as being completely offset by the sniper rifle ads duration changes but this was incorrect while sniper rifles will be snappier across the board a sniper rifle with snapshot sights will be a little slower to aim down sights than before weapon archetypes does the lightweight pulse rifle damage buff apply to the bxr- battler pulse rifle yes the lightweight pulse rifle buff applies to bxr- battler and any exotic weapons that share that rate of fire is retraced path getting the trace rifle buff yes are slug shotguns also getting the pellet shotgun nerfs slug shotguns receive the damage falloff and aim assist falloff changes slug shotguns don't have a spread angle but are treated like special weapons and have an airborne accuracy penalty are there any changes to aggressive aka spread fusion rifles no they're not affected by any of the fusion rifle tuning do all smgs benefit from the damage falloff increase yes do all smgs with lower than zoom now have no only those listed in the twab have been raised to what happened to the full-auto setting we mentioned that this is coming in a season following the witch queen launch it won t make it into season or and is currently targeted for season are the numbers in the fusion rifle section correct what does this mean for a charge-time masterwork yes to clarify a bit these are how much the damage falloff near distance is reduced compared to current at and range i e yes the damage falloff for range was reduced more than that for range reduced damage falloff near distance - m at range m when ads with a -zoom stat - m at range m when ads with a -zoom stat this is the damage per burst of a charge-time masterwork on each subfamily compared to the base high impact base precision base adaptive base rapid fire base why are there no sidearm changes sidearms are a niche pick but when used by players who favor them they're extremely strong we want to see how the reduction in effective range of shotguns and fusion rifles affects their strength before making any changes and may look at them in a future season that auto rifle change is somewhat small will it do anything combined with the zoom scalar this change is larger than it sounds but we plan to look at primary weapon balance some more in season auto rifles included why did the summoner only come back for two seasons we were adding new weapon reissued weapon and removing old weapons from the trials loot pool each season but we felt like only one brand-new trials weapon per season wasn't enough now that we're doing new trials weapons a season we'd rather the pool contain mostly the newer weapons trace rifles and machine guns are both getting buffed does this suggest future anti-champion mods no comment exotic weapons is vex mythoclast a fusion rifle when it comes to airborne effectiveness and what is its stat vex mythoclast's airborne effectiveness stat is and it's treated as an auto rifle for translating the stability stat into flinch resistance and how its airborne effectiveness stat is translated so about wavesplitter hold on a sec wavesplitter's functionality changed late in development and the twab description was not entirely accurate wavesplitter's variable damage while firing was not removed this weapon's damage behaves identically to how it did before this release i e it changes while firing changes to orb max-charge time are still accurate and it does suppress while in the orb-derived high-power state is riskrunner staying at zoom what about osteo striga yes to riskrunner osteo striga has a unique setup for damage and aim assist falloff that is less affected by its zoom stat but no its zoom isn't changing is lumina included in the damage buff reduction yes lumina noble rounds and boots of the assembler seekers now also grant damage in pvp down from but the original value in pve this damage buff is also used by sun warrior which is part of why loreley splendor helm is so strong but wasn't mentioned in the mega-twab because that issue is being addressed in another way is le monarque affected by necrotic grip le monarque is not a weapon of sorrow and is not going to become one the only weapons that count as weapons of sorrow currently in the game are thorn and osteo striga does lorentz driver's change also apply to arbalest no but we'll be looking at both of these again in the future are devil's ruin and fighting lion being monitored for being unique for their own ammo economy while dancing the primary special line we expect both of these to be stronger in the season weapons sandbox but not so strong that they'll dominate we do stand ready to make adjustments if needed though they're both acquired tastes whose strengths can't be exploited by every player how does the eyes of tomorrow buff work it's a straight-up x damage scalar on the current damage values against bosses and champions note that the adaptive ordnance perk does not expire so you can potentially get a bunch of eyes of tomorrow kills pick up more heavy ammo and go into a boss fight with that damage buff just to clarify how this works a little more every legendary weapon type and every exotic weapon can have its own custom scalar against each tier of enemy e g minor major champion miniboss boss vehicle which we touch occasionally if needed damage values vs players are the base numbers in almost all cases we typically scale the damage up or down in pve as needed pretty borders previously on the twab we spoke about some quality-of-life changes for weapon crafting we ve already increased the element caps from to and the neutral element cap from to and in season we are still planning to remove ruinous adroit mutable drowned and energetic elements only neutral elements will remain one other feedback item we see cropping up a lot is the desire to masterwork your crafted weapons if only to get those shiny gold borders that let you know that a weapon is special starting in season you will have the ability to achieve the masterworked look for crafted weapons to get your gold border on legendary crafted weapons you will need to have an enhanced intrinsic perk and two enhanced trait perks crafted exotics will require a catalyst to be inserted and the winner is earlier this week we put the choice of what map to feature for trials of osiris in your hands we love democracy and let the community choose what battlefield would be featured next here are the final results altar of flame wins with of the vote vostok came in second with fragment received tomorrow altar of flame will be the featured map for this week s trials of osiris good luck out

       " Document(page_content=\"this week at bungie we talk about pixels and the kilts for kids fundraising event welcome to your first april installment of the twab yes you read that right we re already in the fourth month of the year time is flying by and we can t help but wonder why maybe it s the fact that we shipped an expansion in february or the weekly hunts for deepsight weapons that we ve been embarking on in any case destiny keeps going strong gambit labs went live earlier this week invasion swap has been getting us some great anecdotal feedback for mote-dunking and invasion strategies and we re excited to see the data and feedback as it comes in we did have a small hiccup on tuesday where the pinnacle reward for playing three matches was not appearing but the team quickly issued a server-side fix to get you your just rewards paired with double gambit rep it s a great week to complete some seasonal challenges for bright dust and earn some nice gambit-themed rewards grandmaster nightfalls have also returned bringing our most challenging strike content back into the fold we ve got a slight clarification on some patch notes back from launch dealing with acute burns in destiny update it was incorrectly noted that these burns would not be present in grandmaster difficulty acute burns are intentional and replace the unique strike modifiers smaller burns plus extra knockback or splash damage the new seasonal modifiers invisible enemies etc are not included in grandmasters we have updated our patch notes page to reflect with that said we highly recommend using some elemental damage resist mods on your chest pieces as you buildcraft for the difficulty looking to next week iron banner returns while we re planning a larger twab to cover upcoming changes our one piece of advice to you this week is to spend your iron banner tokens complete your iron banner quest and redeem your iron banner bounties we have some updates to saladin and how he ll be dishing out rewards which naturally leads to the retirement of iron banner tokens and bounties you have two iron banner weeks left to spend these tokens for rewards including next week so make sure to plan some time in the tower to turn them in before the end of the final iron banner of the season oh and a small update from the team we're looking to prevent the abilities bounty for our final iron banners before next season we ve heard and felt the feedback that it could be a bit time consuming so we re shifting to focus on objective and weapon bounties for the remainder of the season happy hunting so what else is going on this week we ll be celebrating the upcoming kilts for kids fundraiser and having a quick story time about a wonderful community event that occurred last weekend kilts for kids year after year the bungie foundation participates in numerous charity initiatives to raise funds for people in need while we host our own streams and charity drives once a year

date thank you for bringing hope smiles and comfort to kids in need by participating in this fun annual tradition we can t wait to share the impact of your support with all of you pixel by pixel place by r place last weekend was one to remember it started small with the placement of a pixel within minutes it grew to four days of community memes art ace of spades and a raid boss that couldn t stop moving their legs if you don t frequently visit reddit a wonderful weekend event kicked off where any user in the world could place a pixel on a board to start creating small or large pieces of art this wonderland of expression has appeared only a few times in previous years going by the name of r place while your individual efforts could yield success for a short while this place has become a home for reddit communities or communities in general to rally their members to secure a place on the board now it s not as simple as placing a pixel and calling it done participants could override a given pixel placement at any time on a five-minute cooldown to take over spots on the board or simply bring some chaos to the conversation this leads to a few things intense community competitions between millions of different people from given message boards communities or even countries all seeking to claim some place space this also results in wonderfully positive moments when communities create alliances with each other helping one another to defend their artwork as the weekend raged on through the weekend two destiny specific reddit communities r dtg and r destiny led the charge in securing a spot on the board to represent the destiny community through discord chats text messages forum posts and multiple other means of communication the community effectively locked down the destiny spot through all four days this wasn t just a simple tricorn and i m still blown away by the coordination between hundreds to thousands of participants to execute on the art below to celebrate their efforts and the alliances they made with other communities in gaming and non-gaming communities the following emblem is now available for redemption at www bungie net en codes redeem crushed gamma emblem code d -ycx- jk cheers to all who contributed over the weekend and thanks for yet another year of fond memories to look back on whenever we reminisce about telesto and its resiliency

with some fun quotes about the experience of playing the expansion we re proud of where the witch queen landed and we re ever-thankful to all who jumped in to play don t get us wrong the train doesn t stop with some nice quotes about the game the future is bright and we have work to do as we reach further into the stars season of redacted is just a couple of months out and the team is hard at work

last call unbroken survival is the name of the game when it comes to our competitive crucible playlist we offer powerful rewards to players who take on the challenge each season as they reach for the power cap alongside a slew of triumphs to earn for those who wish to display their crucible mastery we offer the unbroken seal and title it takes three full seasons of reaching legend in the competitive playlist alongside other triumph requirements to earn the unbroken seal this week we have a short update from the development team on future availability of this seal dev team for the season release we are taking a pass on glory and how players engage with it in the crucible what playlists offer glory how do players earn it what does becoming legend look like while we can t answer any of these questions just yet we wanted to plant a flag in the sand for the timeframe as part of our updates for glory the unbroken seal and title will be retired due to the multi-season requirements of glory reach legend three seasons in a row season i e right now will be the last season for players to start their journey to unbroken as such we wanted to keep players informed on our plans currently the unbroken seal requirements are significantly more time consuming than any other seal and we would like to bring it into line with the other seals players who attain the seal prior to its retirement will still be able to display it including a gilding count we are intending on replacing it with a similarly challenging crucible seal just with less required multi-season commitment we will have more information on that as we get closer to season so if you re just starting your march towards the unbroken title now is the time to get your legend ranks completed in the competitive playlist we ll have reminders each season to keep players informed and will provide updates on our future crucible plans over the next few seasons in the short term we do have another title coming to the crucible we know you re howling for a bit more information but expect additional details on that when we get closer to next season a week for rituals next week we have quite a bit going on in the

weekend so there s something for everyone grandmasters of the universe season of the risen edition on tuesday april grandmaster nightfalls will make their return to destiny for those that may not have taken on a grandmaster nightfall before this activity is the top of the mountain when it comes to strike content here s a quick breakdown grandmasters require a total of power so you ll want to maximize your pinnacle power and get some bonus seasonal artifact power before taking on the challenge combatants can take more hits deal more damage and are far more aggressive champions will appear in many encounters so be sure to work with your team as you build your loadouts revives are limited so you ll want to be careful and strategic as you make you fight through each encounter darkness will slowly encroach on your ability to revive teammates so don t take too long as you make your way to the boss of course what would the challenge be without a little loot at the end of it the conqueror seal and title can be earned by those who complete grandmaster nightfalls and associated challenges if you ve already completed conqueror you ll have the ability to gild your title as well by completing all of the grandmaster nightfalls during a given season as a reminder if you are gilding all nightfalls will immediately be available to complete no more waiting until the end of the

time to run through some nightfalls or a quick jaunt through the vanguard ops playlist gambit labs invasion swap next tuesday gambit labs will make its first appearance in destiny now that we ve gotten a slew of bug fixes and some minor tuning in place through the last few hotfixes it s time to hit the labs both gambit matchmaking nodes main and freelance will be updated to feature gambit

invasion strategies might change in a few ways for both invaders and bankers go for largest blockers to start stagger large and small blockers to keep your opponents on their toes invade immediately

       " Document(page_content=\"this week at bungie we are but days away from the launch of the witch queen we re finally here the last twab before the witch queen over the last few weeks we ve been touching on new systems arriving on february picking through some quality of life changes for the rituals you engage with and even spending some time with the team in a full-length vidoc to set the stage for what s coming we have a few topics left to cover but only a few days stand between you and the next chapter of destiny season of the lost is wrapping up this week no better way than with a final mission to tee-up our next expansion have you played through it yet no well get in there we know the witch queen is coming but this is a fun close to the season that you won t want to miss as a note the team has been investigating a few issues with the activity since it went live you may need to play it a few times for the quest to complete and we ask that if you re matchmaking in please don t skip the cutscene outside of that we also have an exotic ship to cap off the season that we ll be distributing at a later date to players who own season of the lost stay tuned for updates if you ve completed the mission and already reading this twab i d assume you re gobbling up every bit of information you can before release have you seen the launch trailer yet i hope so if not let s take a moment to roll the tape and listen to some slick music if you d still like to go in completely spoiler-free this is your final warning truth be told i ve been replaying this trailer in my head for the last week or so what does it all mean well we ll all find out next week when the expansion goes live if you re looking for just a little more video content to watch we also released a fun mini-vidoc exploring the creation of glaives the new weapon type coming to destiny with the witch queen it s always a pleasure to get the team out to talk about their beautiful creations i ve said it before but they really do make magic out of math multiple teams collaborating through conversation code and ridiculous amounts of talent to create the weapons and worlds that you enjoy in destiny for our final twab before launch we have a few goodies in store the team will be running us through upcoming changes and tuning to gambit we ll take a quick glance through patch notes for a final preview an updated twitch emblem coming next week and a fun steelseries partnership to talk through let s get to it i really need to find another way to transition from twab intros don t i alright alright alright time for gambit drifter s hungry no not for hive but for the spotlight well maybe some hive too but let s focus on gameplay as we continue to improve and iterate on the rituals of destiny gambit is taking center stage this isn t a teardown and rebuilding of an existing mode but a moment for our teams to realign on goals and how we re serving up the goods to our players a few months back the development team walked through our first ritual update focused on trials of osiris when you look at it there weren t numerous changes but targeted pieces of tuning and adjustments to push a healthier experience engram focusing and trials ranks were introduced to help players earn that sweet piece of loot they ve always wanted even if they weren t winning many matches minor changes to passages and matchmaking were made to help get more players into trials freelance and labs weekends continue as we gather valuable data to inform the future of the mode at the end of the day trials is still elimination and saint is still a badass with gambit or any mode we may update in the future you can expect a similar approach today principal designer alan blaine will be joining us to break down our goals for gambit and what changes the team is making to get us to where we want to be alan when we added gambit back in forsaken in the fall of was it really three and a half years ago we were closing a gap in destiny pursuits we had lots of places in the game to shoot aliens in the face or juicebox and we had places where you could face off against other guardians but we had no place where you could face off against other guardians by shooting aliens in the face fundamentally gambit is a pve horde firefight mode culminating in a race to kill the boss first meanwhile you can throw small and large roadblocks in front of the other team racing you or be the roadblock by invading opponents powered up and loaded for bear later that year we added gambit prime a souped-up gambit with armor-based player roles and then it really didn't change much for a couple of years with beyond light we streamlined both versions into what gambit is today combining some of the best parts of the original gambit and gambit prime without attempting to transform the mode or address much of the feedback gambit had generated over the years over the last few months we've taken a pass on gambit to address said feedback and realign the mode with many of its original goals ultimately we believe it is important that in gambit you can showcase both your skill at fighting in destiny and the variety and focus of your arsenal it should be just as inherently fun and rewarding to shoot aliens in the face in gambit as it is elsewhere a good invader should be able to turn the tide of a match but a good invader should be no more important than any other equally-skilled team member a good invader does not have to mean a pvp god loaded up with the best tracking one-hit-kill weaponry players defending against invaders should have ample tools to fight invaders without worrying about using up ammunition dealing with tougher enemies and players should have methods for recovering from a devastating invade it should be rare that a match is out of your hands as a player or that an outcome is pre-ordained early in the match working together with your team to overcome tough enemies the primeval a high-value target or an invader should feel as gratifying as a hard nightfall while we don't always hit those marks gambit has a healthy and stable population ultimately we want to make gambit more appealing to a wider audience by addressing points of player feedback and improving upon what exists without changing the core nature of the mode our hope is that this leads to more players engaging for longer upcoming changes fall into five categories core activity ammo economy primeval tuning invasions rewards core activity changes these changes are all about enhancing teamwork or making the mode easier to play and understand freelance node added we think it's important that players feel like they always have a chance at winning and we see over and over again that full stacks of friends or clanmates have a significant advantage over groups of solo matchmade opponents the modes we have added freelance nodes to iron banner glory and trials of osiris all feel like they end up with more balanced matches more often even as they increase and split the number of matchmaking pools we are investigating ways to remove the need for freelance nodes that split the population and hope to have something for you later this year in the meantime the ability to queue for gambit freelance should be very useful rotating seasonal selection of curated encounters starting in season in classic gambit prime you got a randomly selected encounter from a list of three for each enemy race on each map in beyond light due to production issues we were only able to bring one of the three variations forward into the new activity those issues have been fixed and we are now bringing the missing variations forward playing with the single variation for race map for a year led us to an interesting observation it's fun to know that 'hive on pacifica' means oh god those shriekers and to learn the spawns and master them over time maybe not interesting for an entire year but we think it will be interesting to have a set rotation of spawns for a season and over those three months really master each encounter so no more shriekers on pacifica for now but they will be back later in the year respawn points added to all fronts sections of maps where enemies could cycle in or out it can be frustrating to always have to run all the way from the backfield after spawning before you are able to help teammates fight the invader collect dropped motes etc it can also be very frustrating as an invader to always spawn at the same location on the same map multiple times in a row or to have the invader camp the entrance to avoid confrontation more respawn points spread throughout fronts should help you get back into the action faster and provide for less predictable spawn points during invasions players always drop half the motes they were carrying when they are defeated these can be picked up by anyone including invaders invaders can also drop more motes now this makes recovering from a ruthless invader or bad luck fighting enemies a little easier players can be revived by other players two seconds earlier and auto-respawn is delayed two seconds we want to emphasize and reward teamwork as much as possible bringing your teammate back and saving them a run now is even easier this change should also reduce the frustrating moments of teammates being forced to respawn as you re halfway through the revive interact when your teammate dies and you run to grab their dropped motes stop for a second and revive them will ya all shields have increasing resistance to non-matching damage types while not as severe as match game resistance in nightfalls we wanted a way to promote buildcrafting and teamwork rules of gambit node added to the launch screen and numerous gambit-specific hints have been added to the load screen gambit can be a bit opaque to newcomers this should give them a leg up blockers draining and the bank while we didn't do any drastic adjustments here we have a few tweaks we think will increase interesting decisions both when sending and battling blockers and hopefully remove the feeling of helplessness as you pour ammo into three knights as all of your motes drain away mote phalanx blocker has its health boosted a bit while they are a good positional challenge with their shield and knockback we felt like they weren't quite tough enough for their mote cost compared to the knight so we increased their health mote knight blocker gains a stasis attack we originally planned to pull its health down some as we felt it was a little too beef for motes but with the ammo changes below we didn't find the current health onerous in playtesting we did think they could be more tactically interesting with a stasis attack without necessarily making them more deadly or harder to kill mote drain from multiple blockers continues even if the opposing team is in primeval phase this will help the team that is behind get to the primeval a little quicker it's never felt great to send over four blockers only to have the enemy team ignore them all while still being severely behind this also gives the team in the lead a bit more incentive to kill blockers during their primeval phase mote drain is paused if a player is near the bank and engaging blockers it never feels great to have your motes draining away while you pour primary ammo into three taken knights ammo economy our goal for these changes are to make a more predictable and equal baseline of special and heavy ammo among all players we will be watching both feedback and analytics around ammo gain and usage rates and we ll continue to make tweaks if these aren't enough to make fair matches when completing a front a chest containing a small amount of special and heavy ammo spawns in the middle of the front and can be looted once by each player it times out seconds after the initial interact so you still can't dilly-dally killing a high-value target spawns one normal heavy brick for each player during the primeval phase ammo chests spawn in one of the fronts every seconds this replaces the regular front ammo chests - but you still need to find the time to go grab it limited special and heavy ammo bricks to only spawn from enemies if you have finder mods equipped other ammo exotics and perks like aeon cult still work the primeval fight the primeval fight is the ultimate challenge of gambit it should feel like an epic boss fight and be long enough for the opposing team to get off some invades to counter strong dps it should have more to do than simply burning the boss as quickly as possible and turn in place to kill envoys every once in a while its mechanics shouldn't be complex but should require about as much tactical play as a high-end strike boss primeval health and slayer stack bonus retuned burning the boss after three rounds of envoys should be just as easy as it is now but burning him after just one or two rounds should be significantly more work envoys now spawn with friends out in the fronts rather than in the bank area they have reduced health and are no longer affected by slayer stacks and have varied elemental shields killing the envoys to get slayer stacks will require movement dealing with the envoy s protectors and dealing with their elemental shield envoys put an invulnerability shield on primeval you must kill them both to remove it and damage the primeval forcing your team to go out and invade envoys respawn at of the primeval damage done this increases by every envoy respawn and envoys stop spawning after the fifth spawn the primeval servitor boss is removed since its custom shielding mechanics conflicted with the new mechanics the malfeasance quest starts on the first primeval kill with the tuning changes above the motes phase is significantly quicker and the primeval phase longer you should expect matches to be just about as long as they are now but we will be watching to make sure they aren't too short or too long invasions as we said above a good invader should be able to turn the tide of a match but a good invader should be no more important than any other equally-skilled team member we don't want a single good invader to completely dominate match outcome and they certainly can right now however we still want a good invader to be able to delay a strong pve team from finishing off the primeval level advantage is now disabled for invader pvp it has actually been like this since the start of beyond light surprise one of the mote phase invasions has been removed invasions now trigger at and mote thresholds primeval phase invasions are unchanged invasions can no longer be saved up use it or lose it pal invader no longer can see how many motes enemy players are carrying and player nameplates fade out when the invader is aiming down their sights you can still see players through walls just not while you are engaging your rocket tracking or using your sniper zoom we found a bug with how the primeval heal effect was being applied which depending on the sequence and timing of kills would heal the primeval for somewhere between and we fixed it and now invader kills heal the primeval for exactly every time this sounds like a lot but is actually less than the optimal amount prior we will be watching feedback and analytics very closely on this one and will retune as necessary rewards gambit is the second of the core rituals after trials of osiris to get comprehensive engram focusing options focusing you can focus the gambit engram into either 'gambit armor' or 'gambit weapons' for glimmer and legendary shards gambit weapons includes crowd pleaser bottom dollar trinary system borrowed time and servant leader brand new gambit weapons are drop-only for a single season and are then available for focusing we expect to expand drifter's focusing options further during upcoming seasons other drifter changes bygones trust bad omens have been removed from the vendor end match drops there is a gambit memento for weapon crafting that can drop after any match older gambit shaders now have a small chance of dropping at the end of each match primeval servitor cosmetic drops can now drop at the end of any match the furtive shell ghost can now drop at the end of any match yes you can expect more rituals to get this treatment throughout the year but we do not currently have any specific dates to share just yet stay tuned the future and gambit labs there are a few things eagle-eyed readers might notice are missing from the above don't fret we do have a timeline for future changes the daily gambit bounty objectives are generally fine but some of the repeatable bounties have some onerous completion requirements we are taking a pass on these though they won't all come at once sometime this season we will be adjusting the completion amounts of most gambit repeatable bounties weapon kills drop from to melee and grenade kills from to and super kills from to in season we will be making additional tuning changes as well as adding three new bounties throughout the year we will also be adding bounties specific to light updates gambit labs invasion edition we also have a couple of gambit labs that play with some of the core invasion concepts these will run for one week each and will take over the base gambit nodes invasion swap this labs variation plays around with who gets to benefit from triggered invasions during motes phase instead of opening your own invasion portal at and motes you instead open your opponent's invasion portal we expect this to completely disrupt the accepted meta for how and when to deposit and invade we're looking forward to seeing the clever strategies and counterstrategies you will develop mote thief fundamentally the original concept of the invader was guardian as taken terror overpowered and dangerous something new to have to fight while that is very compelling we don't believe it is the only compelling invader fantasy we believe the sneaky mote thief is worth exploring too maybe there are more normal mote drain from having two blockers is disabled instead every second the invader is invading one mote drains directly from your bank to the invader's bank what about trials and what's next fear not trials fans while our main focus for season is gambit we still have some fun changes planned as we discussed earlier this season we are going to continue to liberally schedule capture zone and freelance weekends as well as a few reputation updates coming for season we are moving to a schedule of seven maps for the season one of which you will get to decide expect a survey to come out in the next few weeks to vote on the final map we also have some adept reward changes coming for season we ll preview those later in the season what's next you might ask we are still ironing out the details so we don't have anything to share today not even a lore drop however we are planning to make the next four seasons a banner year for rituals and we hope our season plans will spark joy for everyone we hope all the guardians that love or fear gambit give the mode another try once the witch queen launches we've really enjoyed playtesting it and we're going to be listening to your feedback and making adjustments final patch note preview here s a quick roundup of patch notes for next tuesday think of this as a kitchen sink of patch notes a little bit of everything ritual rewards starting with the witch queen ritual playlist rewards will be updated

       " Document(page_content=\"this week at bungie we showed off a heck of a lot including more void goodness we re also setting some legendary campaign expectations alongside a special tribute to our heroes what a week so far and we still have just a little more time to go before the witch queen finally arrives later this month a lot of new info has dropped this week with an enticing new vidoc and the breakdown many have been asking for regarding void feeling like the rest of us and can t wait to jump right into the next chapter of the destiny story we get it while we can t would love to but can t gift the community with an early drop there is an interactive experience available now that centers around savath n herself and getting to know the enemy up close and personal curious as you should be feel free to mosey on over to that special experience right here after reading this twab of course we re bonding all about that void another juicy tidbit that you may have missed is the hefty new blog post that offers a closer look at the revamped void class a change that is free for all players and one that just honestly feels really good for showing enemies who is boss to read the full breakdown check out our destiny developer team blog post here with a few key points broken down in a simpler format below the introduction of aspects and fragments first introduced in stasis with the beyond light expansion this offers players more options to choose from with how they take to battle aspects are class-specific items that players can choose when using their revamped void abilities fragments are non-class specific perks that are there as additional enhancements to how gameplay feels titansward of dawn can now be almost completely instantly activated while also becoming the fastest super cooldown tier for ease of access this change makes ward of dawn even more of a powerful defensive tools sentinel shield will still let titans harness their inner captain america with thrown shields providing ranged damage as a shield bash grants a full overshield titan aspects include controlled demolition bastion and offensive bulwark all of which can be found in the full blog post here huntershunters will still be the epitome of stealth now with even more control over what their enemies see or don't see moebius quiver changes will fire off a volley of three arrows that can track targets and make them volatile when tethered deadfall will see the void anchors pull in enemies to a desired location from surface and target impact snare bomb melee will also do more to weaken opponents particularly in pvp when it removes an enemy player's hud and obstructs their in-game view hunter aspects include trapper's ambush vanishing step and stylish executioner warlocksfloat like a warlock sting like a bee because void fine-tunes what makes warlocks so valuable and makes them truly a force to be reckoned with the nova warp super with the vortex super enhancements allows players to teleport efficiently to unleash the ultimate void attack while drawing enemies in and trapping them within a web of damage nova bomb with the cataclysm enhancement allows for more control when warlocks are on the hunt for enemies to take out particularly in pvp instances and detonations will disperse into smaller tracking-tracking projectiles shoot the nova bomb and it'll also detonate early void melee with pocket singularity unleashes void that detonates when near foes making them volatile while controlling their position in relation to the blast zone warlock aspects include chaos accelerant feed the void and child of the old gods what about new lights that s a good question glad you asked new lights or new players as we refer to them in the destiny community will be able to

including more about fragments the full blog post can be found right here to be devoured see what we did there legendary campaign it really do be like that sometimessome guardians have been asking for more of a challenge so the team here at bungie has created the new legendary campaign mode that will arrive when the witch queen drops later this month from reward drops to how it will differ on a base level we wanted to dive just a little bit deeper into what this new challenging experience has to offer to do just that we ve got design lead matt mcconnell offering some insight into some of the most frequently asked questions about the challenge ahead what are the main rewards of completing missions at legendary difficulty we've got double chest rewards offering - extra chests per mission each chest will give you world pool gear xp upgrade modules and glimmer legendary players will be able to earn throne world armor and unlocks at a faster rate basically higher the risk means higher the reward especially when getting to the new power level soft cap in the witch queen are there any unique rewards for completing the story on legendary difficulty completing all missions on legendary will award players with the following a new emblem exclusive to those who complete the campaign at legendary difficulty a triumph required for the newest title for throne world a set of gear above the soft cap at power level eight upgrade modules new the witch queen exotic armor that typically is reserved for ped lost sector drops exclusive bungie rewards more on that in the future some players have been asking if this is a difficulty to be feared - how challenging is it to set difficulty expectations the legendary campaign is designed to be harder than a legend nightfall though it is easier than a solo dungeon or running a grandmaster nightfall enemies are more difficult and more aggressive they also have higher damage resistance are more of a challenge to stagger and shield are stronger to unmatched damage types the challenge of legendary also comes from switching up enemy interactions and infiltration like swapping out an elite for a boss or having an influx of more red bar foes can i over-level this content each mission caps your power similar to the raid contest mode so that all guardians have an even playing field to avoid feeling like every step is a grind the mission launch screen will have a skull displaying each mission's max effective power if you're under-level be prepared for a bit of a tough fight the mighty are forged in battle but is it that way for solo players too we've had a lot of aspirational content in the past but legendary gives us a chance to give solo players more equal footing with those that opt into playing with a fireteam enemy damage and health scales to match your fireteam though it won't be - because triple the boss health isn't fun even still it will be enough to keep even a veteran trio on their ornamented toes we also didn't want to trivialize darkness encounters compared to solo play so you're limited to one revive per player for each darkness zone and a shared timer of seconds before an automatic wipe happens we've said it time and time again but you have got to stay close to your friends and be ready and able to pick them up when they fall will players be able to tone things down if legendary is a bit too much for their playthrough for those folks that find the difficulty of legendary too overwhelming at first there is an option to leave a mission and relaunch it through the classic destiny settings some players will want to focus more on the story than on sweat for that first run and that's totally fine we want to support that for those who want more of a challenge later we've added nodes to replay any the witch queen campaign mission on classic or legendary any time - after you've beaten the mission once of course basically prepare to go ham - or don't the choice is yours heroes are always welcome the destiny community is one of the best in gaming and we want to celebrate how incredible each and every guardian is whether it be our revived community focus spotlights the incredible charity initiatives like guardians of the world or player-driven initiatives like operation save new lights to help guide newbies through new content there is a lot to be thankful for when looking at the destiny player base one more way we are celebrating the majesty that is all of you gun-toting fashionistas out there is through a new series heroes welcome a new ongoing video adventure that will focus on the players themselves in a vibrantly explosive tribute as seen in the style of our kickoff video below the first video is just the beginning in future features we will directly showcase real players within the community to bring your destiny legends to life while we aim to inspire new lights around the world as an example one of the destiny heroes we are talking to is none other than the incredible uhmaayyze if the name sounds familiar you may have seen a few bungie developers share his epic impromptu destiny raps on his streams he kills it every time never failing to bring the feel-good vibes that he and his community have to offer are you ready to join the future of destiny good because heroes are always welcome oh you thought we were done oh nay nay we have even more community-driven videos to enjoy we asked talented members of the destiny community and beyond to answer one simple question what is destiny what makes this game so special how does one even begin to describe a game that has evolved so much to a newcomer what is the answer to life the universe and everything in it while that last question could be a twab of its own we re kicking things off with three game takes from solar flair carbot animations and mp edits to see how this expansive world looks through their eyes so sit back and enjoy the jokes the tips and the gaming lens of these three amazing humans heard you liked new exoticsthese days destiny literally has a fashion show so i think we're long past the days of pretending destiny isn't a massive flex of gear and those sweet sweet dance moves with more exotics on the way as we crush enemy hive ghosts with our bare hands we wanted to give a little sneak peek at some of the new exotic armor that guardians will be able to don and what sort of perks that come with them it's all fun and games in the destiny class war until somebody takes it seriously so without further ado let's dive into what goodies all three classes have in store with a little additional insight from the developer team the loreley splendor helm for titans is more than just a pretty face it has the cauterizing flame perk that allows for sunspots to heal players when they have sun warrior critically wounded no big the perk also ensures that a sunspot is created in your location to give you that one last fighting chance with that quick grenade and melee ability recharge and longer supers plus more damage always a good thing from the developer team playtest name stagspot helm the goal here was to embrace the awesome art and to give sunspot players another choice besides phoenix cradle also melee builds are becoming more popular and this makes higher level difficulty melee more viable at least in theory the titan s hoarfrost-z chest piece is also nothing to scoff at though this one takes a chillier approach to combat for stasis users with the glacial fortification perk when a player uses stasis it allows for a titan s barricade to become an impressive wall of stasis crystals these crystals will slow any target that gets too close while also boosting a player and their fireteam s weapon reload speed stability and range this was a team effort the original idea was to replace barricades with just a single ice block but kevin yanes and the abilities team had some ideas and stuff lying around from beyond light for spawning crystals to spice it up we wanted to have it grant the new benefits of rally barricade and then yanes suggested that the spawned objects could just be a stasis version of a rally barricade window it proved to be a ton of fun and the rest is history ok warlocks you're up first up let s talk about dem legs because warlock mains have definitely been shouting out their love for the new secant filaments armor with the devouring rift perk these shiny walking sticks of power will grant a player devour when they cast their empowering rift allowing for damage from both allies and individual players the ability to disrupt foes but in style this started as what can we give warlocks that would make empowering rift a more viable choice in master content we figured the answer was well it probably has to heal you and eventually we settled on what we called the devouring rift pants overload was added to increase excitement and expand the options players had to build for various champion-enabled content next up are the osmiomancy gauntlets for warlocks with the fervid coldsnap perk this nifty look allows for coldsnap grenades to have an additional charge that will recharge faster when it makes direct impact the seeker spawned from coldsnap grenades also travels further too bonus since hunters had a duskfield modifier and titans had something like a glacier modifier it felt natural to give warlocks something for coldsnap fun fact the ground follow for this is so fast that we had a bug filed to change how it acquired targets the issue a grenade thrown near a combatant's feet could spawn a ground follow that traveled through and behind the enemy then turn around to come directly back toward the warlock by the time the vfx applied it looked like the coldsnaps were actively avoiding hitting targets and speeding directly away instead thankfully that shouldn t be an issue at launch don t worry hunters i still have love for you despite the jokes you ve got some pretty cool gear on the way including the blight ranger helm with the voltaic mirror perk lightening lovers here s where your arc powers can truly shine this perk allows players to redirect with their arc staff to deal an increased amount of damage and orbs of power generation for all allies basically get in there and do some damage sounds like a good time we wanted to make something for arcstrider that leaned into an aspect of the super that doesn t normally get focus there are players that love wielding other people s attacks creatures game pieces etc against them this is for those people and lastly hunters also have the renewal grasps to look forward to with the depths of duskfield perk this gives guardians a much larger radius for their duskfield grenades while also nerfing incoming damage for allies within the duskfield s range any targets locked within that space will also deal out a reduced amount of damage so go out there and make those hive cry stasis hunters now have a sort of mini-silence squall that they can deploy with a grenade this gives revenants the ability to play a more team-focused role or to play more of an area denial control game than they ve been able to before this worm at bungie another week another message from our unsung heroes over at our player support team with a whole new narrative unfolding soon there are quite a few

       " Document(page_content='we re back baby twab is alive and well and we re excited for what s next with the upcoming launch of the witch queen just one more month to go before we learn more about savath n s influence and what that means for guardians and our beloved osiris in addition to some nifty additions to gameplay such as crafting and pokey-pokey glaive goodness while we do want to share some news with our players we also want to keep some secrets because there are a few unique surprises on the way that we want you to experience for yourselves also can we just take a moment to appreciate the latest trailer for the witch queen that showcased savath n s throne world because i don t know about you but i m still screaming in excitement and the entire team here at bungie can t wait to see your reactions to what s next it s going to be a wild ride so buckle that metaphorical seatbelt friends before you dive into the latest trailer below we did want to offer a small warning to players spoilers are coming be aware that the weeks leading up to the launch of the witch queen will include information that those averse to spoilers might want to avoid just be careful out there guardians artifact mods update insert orbs meme here artifact mods have been a huge talking point in our community and with the next season we re making a few changes that will bring back some popular anti-champion mods while also making some tweaks to the way masterwork armor works here is a rundown from the team on what players can look forward to in season team one of the consistent pieces of feedback that we have been wanting to act on for a while involves the unlocking of artifact mods starting in season players will no longer be limited to the number of artifact mods they can unlock this means that players could feasibly unlock all artifact mods by the end of the season while we have made some small adjustments to the amount of xp required to unlock artifact mods - in general the pace of unlocking these first twelve artifact mods should be close to what we ve seen in season s artifact for each unlock after the th increased xp will be required for the next artifact mod unlock so the choice of which order to unlock mods still requires some decision-making and if you change your mind you can still reset your artifact and make your picks again when it comes to the artifact mods themselves we are bringing back a few perennial favorite anti-champion mods including anti-barrier scout rifles and bows and have done some work to make disrupting an overload champion which can be done this season with auto-rifles and smgs more reliable than in previous seasons we ll also be highlighting the new glaive weapon archetype coming in the witch queen through a variety of artifact mods including an option to make your glaive the solution to unstoppable champions and have a few new artifact mods that will enhance some of the new weapon perks to take a little bit of pressure off your vault space we are also making some adjustments to the way masterwork armors work starting with the launch of the witch queen you can change the energy type of a fully-masterworked piece of armor for a much-reduced cost a fully masterworked piece of legendary armor can be changed to another energy type for the cost of glimmer and one upgrade module while a fully masterworked piece of exotic armor can be changed to another energy type for the cost of glimmer and one upgrade module the costs for changing a piece of armor s energy type before it is fully masterworked remain unchanged closing out we are also making a change to the way guardians create orbs of power with weapons elements of the new weapon crafting system will encourage you to use many different weapons and ask you to burn hard-earned masterwork materials on a weapon that you may only be using for a few hours just to generate orbs that seemed like a tall order this combined with our desire to act on consistent feedback that players want to be able to generate orbs of power with exotic weapons that do not yet have catalysts led us to the implementation we ll be using in the witch queen and beyond orb generation on weapon multikills will no longer be a function of a weapon s masterwork status but will instead be provided by a suite of armor mods which are unlocked automatically for all players and which plug into the helmet armor mod socket each such mod will apply the orb-generation effect to all weapons you have equipped of a particular damage type so a single mod will cover multiple weapons in your arsenal if they share a damage type this also applies to a weapon that changes damage types like hard light or a kinetic weapon with osmosis we will continue to create exciting exotic catalysts over the next few seasons but in the meantime you will be able to generate orbs with cloudstrike thorn thunderlord tarrabah and any other weapon in the game th anniversary content will they or won t they has been a major question surrounding the th anniversary event we have game shows we have a weird sarcastic horse made of stardust and puns and we have a dungeon that will make you laugh

brief update before we take an end-of-year break we re excited for the upcoming trials labs before the end of the year this week is trials labs freelance a separate node where everyone playing queues by themselves the mode is perfect if you don't have a regular team but may even be a space for you to find other players to party up with for some flawless success in the team node this week is also a labs where we do not require the trials intro quest to launch into the nodes the only requirements are owning beyond light and being at power level or higher while trials can be a bit competitive we hope this variation will open up pvp to more players and introduce them to some sweet rewards and fuel more desire to give the crucible a try from time to time december will be our last twab of the year so we are announcing this well in advance on december -jan we will be running another trials labs freelance if you d like to ring in the new year alone we ve got the playlist just for you wait no that's a sad way to look at it if you re looking for a playlist that you can enter solo and potentially meet lifelong friends in we ve got the playlist just for you expect an additional capture zone

rotation stay tuned for future announcements moments of triumph ah yes moments of triumph it s one of our favorite times of year looking back at all our accomplishments of the past year and

your adventures in dares of eternity we have a collection of rewards for you to earn in-game showing your dedication over the last year of course if you complete all required triumphs and collect all the rewards you will unlock the mmxxii seal and title before we do a quick preview of rewards we d like to pass the mic to the dev team to explain some of the inspirations behind this year s design team moments of triumph mot is always a special time for us but this year it hits different not only are we celebrating your incredible achievements across the solar system and dimensions this past year but we also get to celebrate a triumph of our own bungie s th anniversary one might argue that s twice as much celebration as last year and you know what you d be right we ve channeled this celebratory spirit into this year s new mot crest in a few fun ways we thought were worth sharing three swords rest in the top right corner in honor of our th anniversary each a decade of doing what we love and being inspired by you flowers spring to life across the crest honoring heroes lost embracing change and symbolizing growth across seasons the guardian s ship lifts off towards new adventure in the lower left corner beyond the unforgiving cold of europa to explore the stars once more there are other secrets to uncover of course but we ll leave that to you now let s look at some sweet loot if you re looking to show your guardian prowess in the real world we have a new round of bungie rewards for you to unlock and purchase from the bungie store if you so desire with our yearly t-shirt offering we also have the moments of triumph seal pin for your jackets pinboards or whatever you may stick these things on there is one last bungie reward that could be unlocked taking the form of a coin you may remember from years past your yearly quest for the moments of triumph t-shirt begins next week when the th anniversary goes live armor mods update let s talk glimglam kicking off our list of qol updates otherwise known as quality of life the team has been working on a change that many of you have been asking about for a while have you ever been tinkering with your armor mods and thinking well this is taking quite a bit of glimmer or even running out in the process well starting on december this will no longer be an issue starting next week you can swap out your armor mods instantaneously at any time with no glimmer or currency required the goal of the team is to better enable build crafting on the fly whether you be loading into a pvp match or prepping for a nightfall we ve also seized this opportunity to make free and reversible socket actions available to all rd party destiny apps starting on december so in addition to equipping gear and transferring items to from the vault your favorite d apps will be able to apply armor mods weapon perks shaders ornaments and ghost projections on your behalf while this may not be a solution to every build craft feedback item it is a step forward as the team looks to dialing in build crafting and loadout opportunities for destiny in the future the team will also be looking at artifact mod resets and costs in the future but general armor mod swapping is a great first step as we said earlier this enables third party community apps to change mods at the tap of a finger on your phone screen or the click of a mouse on browsers we re excited for how our community will take advantage of this as it could open the door to potential loadouts for things like nightfalls or pvp modes on the note of third party apps we d like to take a moment and show some appreciation for api developers out there in our community while we ve featured some through community focus articles in the past we d also like to grant an in-game emblem to celebrate them and their work it may be a small token of appreciation but we hope it s worn with pride here s a quick preview of the parallel program emblem if you're running around the cosmodrome and notice this emblem show some love and do a little dance emote away so these creators feel some love if there are any destiny community apps that you use frequently give them a shout out on social media or on our bungie net forums we d love to feature more in the future and make sure to get these emblems shared around we ve already started granting a few but we have far more to dish out if you ve created an app to help the destiny community we ll likely be in touch soon exciting stuff right this isn t the only qol change that will be coming next week keep reading for a quick list of upcoming items we re excited about our final patch note preview of our th anniversary release will be our last content drop until the witch queen sure we might have a hotfix or two before the year is out but this will be our last big patch we re excited for dares of eternity and the new dungeon but we re also looking forward to releasing some qol improvements that have been requested by players for some time photosensitivity changes screen explosions reduced the bright flash intense glows updated near fade on particles hive headshot and darkness blast hive headshot vfx intensity reduced hive darkness blast detonation and projectile intensity reduced taken projectiles and muzzle flashes arc rifle taken slug rifle necromancer vfx reduced intensity and normalized lights hallowed lair boss fight adjusted intensity particle near fade for multiple vfx in boss fight area of effect tell intensity how players understand the boss is casting lightning lightning strike particles and light intensity reduced impact particle near fades updated cloud brightness animation frequencies slowed down decals reduced in intensity scorn vfx intensity of spawn object effects performance and near fades updated on spawn toxic muzzle flash projectile performance and intensity tweaks finisher intensity adjusted shader and lights on finisher to not bloom arc abilities screen effects arc object effect debuff have reduced intensity when in close proximity first person reduced on off flashings of arc screen effects reduced on off flashing of arc screen shaders blind well dreaming city weapons now drop more frequently upon successful blind well completions if you re looking to round out your dreaming city weapon collection we highly recommend giving the blind well a few runs exotic ornaments previews and purchases starting next tuesday we'll be adding a new avenue for players to discover and acquire exotic ornaments while players may still hop in to the eververse to purchase exotic ornaments they will also be visible and purchasable when inspecting a given exotic weapon or armor piece as an example le monarque will be receiving a sweet new ornament in the th anniversary release thanks to a recent community poll for future ornaments thanks to all who voted when booting up destiny you can inspect your beautiful bow tab down to the ornaments section and purchase the ornament straight from the weapon itself for armor pieces this can be done either by inspecting the armor itself or through the guardian appearance screen featured ornaments may be purchased with silver if the ornament is available for bright dust on a given week it will also be available for bright dust on the inspection screen we hope this makes it a little easier to find these items as we continue to build new looks for existing exotic weapons and armor pieces rusted lands bring back the booms fixed an issue where dynamic objects like barrels or bricks with physics and hive exploding objects were missing from this map the corrupted general strike fixes to reduce the overall length of the strike and make it less painful after hard wipes in the elevator encounter we have removed the taken combatants in the dark ascendant plane hallway leading up to the elevator if a fireteam hard wipes during the final phase of the boss fight in the ascendant realm when they respawn the portal to the ascendant realm will take them straight to phase instead of making them replay the platforming section between phase and phase when a fireteam arrives at the platforming area before the boss fight in the adytum any fireteam members or ghosts left behind in earlier parts of the strike will now be teleported forward to join their fireteam when players begin the elevator encounter any straggler players or their ghosts will be pulled forward to join their fireteam fixed an issue where sedia's shields would regenerate faster than expected on nightfall difficulties her shields now regenerate based on health threshold in nightfalls just like they do in direct launch or the vanguard playlist the portal to the ascendant realm after phase of the boss fight should now reliably place players facing the correct direction fixed an issue that was preventing the combatants from walking to part of the right-side area during the first half of the boss-fight psions should now spread out a little bit more on that right platform fixed an issue where a taken acolytes was spawning and immediately falling to its death during the floating platform area before the boss fight fixed an issue where in certain conditions the relic would de-spawn and never respawn during the boss phase fixed a cosmetic issue where the relic spawners during the boss would spin before the relic was spawned wait what about dunemarchers a few weeks back we let players know that a few issues with dunemarchers would be addressed in the upcoming patch the goal is to remove instances of players being double chained by lightning created by these exotic legs upon a successful titan punch please note that it will still be possible to die to chain lightning when having low health if you ve taken damage from a different opponent or been hit by some aoe damage from a well-placed ballistic slam you may still fall victim to the dunes once a player is hit by a dunemarchers lightning chain they cannot be hit again by dunemarchers for s dunemarchers lightning now only chains on targets that are alive icefall mantlestasis overshield can now be cancelled by pressing the class-ability input once more next tuesday we ll have the full list of patch notes available for your reading pleasure our goal is to get the article out a bit earlier in the morning so our sandbox-focused players can get some eyes on more details for the upcoming abilities changes expect timers for grenades melee s and other abilities that were not covered in our previous twab cross play text chat check-in it s been a

is also making its debut while we don t have a full reveal just yet we do have an awesome ghost shell preview below accompanied with an interview with its artist let s get to it festival of the lost introducing the calavera ghost shell next week festival of the lost kicks off this is a time for guardians to take a moment and reflect upon the past year celebrating those we ve lost as we continue to overcome each challenge that s been thrown our way many of the themes found within festival of the lost can be compared with those of a holiday celebrated by many in our community d a de los muertos day of the dead diversity and representation is not only important in the worlds of destiny but throughout our real-life community and so we re excited to introduce the calavera ghost shell concepted by an incredible artist bungie had the honor of collaborating with luis yepez let s take a moment to meet the mind behind this beautiful creation shall we hi luis can you tell us a little bit about yourself and your background luis of course my full name is luis miguel yepez franco and i was born in mexico city and spent my teenage years in cancun before moving to the us to learn d art and hopefully get to make games i studied at the art institute of phoenix before i got my first game job up here in rainy seattle wa i have been a gamer my whole life and always wanted to do something creative growing up so i figured making games could be my thing and i have been doing that for the last years i also love movies most specifically sci-fi and horror movies i prefer a rainy cozy afternoon with movies family and games at my disposal as my go-to activities how long have you been a destiny player luis honestly i don t remember but i know i started playing during the alpha build of destiny on xbox so definitely a while back in the original destiny days i would run a clan on both xbox one and playstation simultaneously friday and saturday nights were raid nights and i had them scheduled to help the crew on xbox and then immediately jump onto the ps to do it again with another group needless to say when someone wouldn t down crota in the third try schedules got off track not to mention a slightly-off jump in oryx s chamber oh how fun those days were i spent so many hours paying that when destiny launched and all my legendary achievements were shown to me it was a powerful moment acknowledging all that had happened until that point with my crew i continue to be active with season of the splicer being my most absent time from the game since i became a new parent i still have some of my original queens gear from early d which i won't trash for sentimental value no matter how much vault space i may need and for all of you old timers let me assure you i was one of those who never got gjallarhorn to drop until a week before x r sold it so to all the guardians who suffered the same fate you re not alone does that age me in the community i sure hope it does we see that you are also a game artist what type of art do you do luis i used to be a full-time artist over the last seven years i ve switched over into doing more design work i do a lot of layout pacing and open world map designs where i get to use a lot of my skills and knowledge from my time being an artist just with a very different focus on the side i started working on what i call my trixels series a day of the dead inspired style where i model stylized animals and paint them similar to alebrijes i wanted to merge my background and mexican roots with my present and what i do for a living since they seem so opposite of each other and because that s ultimately who i have been shaped to be now i give a lot of details and designs to the animals and hide some stories inside of them like my corgi has squirrels tennis balls paw prints etc it s all related to the animal i am making the one common thread is a lot of color and skulls those are the common themes in my designs you can check them out on ig trixelsart how did the idea of creating a d a de los muertos ghost shell for festival of the lost come about luis it was very casual i was approached by people at bungie who are familiar with my trixels series and was asked if i would be interested in contributing to fotl with some of my design work i don t think i hesitated at all of course i want to from there it was super simple and smooth just drawing some ideas calling out how the designs would be in the different looks and going back and forth with the team on what would work the best with the theme and constraints of the game finally we arrived at the design you see and will be able to get in game real soon trying to come up with the shapes colors and designs so they would read well on the body of the ghost even at a distance was a lot of fun and challenging at the same time the collaboration with everyone involved in this process was super smooth friendly and you could tell that they all care about destiny just as much as we the players do i am super honored to be a long-time player that has now contributed in a unique way to the world of destiny and to the fight against the darkness thank you for adding your voice to the world what are you looking forward to most in the witch queen luis i am really looking forward to revealing the truth and finally taking the fight to the witch queen s doorstep no more hiding this time light will prevail and shine through it's going to be super interesting to see how these two light sources battle it out and if all us guardians will prevail i am almost certain we will almost lol i am also looking forward to all the surprises bungie has in store that we don t even know about as is usual in every season i can't wait to gear up and fight the darkness alongside you if you want to team up you can find me as yeluis on xbox and yupizs on steam for more awesome works from luis be sure to visit his page over at luisyepez com the calavera ghost shell will become available when festival of the lost begins at am pacific on october players may acquire this directly for silver or acquire it with bright dust when it is spotlighted during the event check back on tuesday for an awesome trailer before the event goes live what s in the patch notes alongside festival of the lost we ll be deploying destiny update we have a collection of bugfixes and some quality of life items to deploy here s a quick preview of the goods grandmaster nightfalls increased drop chance for an adept nightfall weapon from a platinum grandmaster nightfall to while this will not guarantee perfect perk combinations on every drop players may now expect to receive an adept reward when overcoming the challenge of grandmasters even on the hardest of weeks the corrupted reduced the

       " Document(page_content=\"this week at bungie we introduced our new d i club the twab must go on we are deep into season of the lost now new secrets are unfolding in the shattered realm each week and the plot is thickening up real nice we don t want to spoil anything here but make sure you are keeping up with seasonal quest and give crow a hug for us this week the iron banner rages on in case you missed it or haven t played this week we increased the score target from to to match the base control mode we also adjusted the mercy threshold to try and reduce the number of games that end shortly before a team reaches the score target let us know how these new changes feel with iron banner being live this weekend we are giving trials the weekend off but we wanted to give one more update on how week three went clinical trials debrief last weekend was the third weekend of our ongoing test and learn the two big changes this week were running the trials labs capture zone mode and tweaking the flawless pool to enable sunday morning at am here are some updates on what the data looked like in week three solo win rate remained high at solo blowout rate was prior to enabling the flawless pool and dropped below after these are all consistent with week two non-competitive matches - - were at on friday saturday and dropped to sunday monday very consistent overall with week two we saw solid sub- -second matchmaking times all weekend aside from early-in-card matchmaking protection causing a slight rise up to s during the middle of the night in north america on sunday and monday overall we had k players participating in labs down k from week two with k players going flawless we had k fewer matches played overall which roughly the same average matches per player one dataset that is particularly informative is average hours played by skill this shows us that the mid-range of skill aka the average crucible player are playing to hours more on average meanwhile the average hours played at the high end of the skill range has barely changed we did find one bug with the way the pool-based matchmaking interacts with disabled pools it collapses them down into the previous pool unfortunately the setup for aiding matchmaking for the first few wins of the week causes an unintentional flawless mini-pool' for the first two wins of the card if you went flawless and are on win- or win- of your reset passage you preferentially match against other flawless players in the same state once you get to win- this goes away and of course starting at am on sundays the entire passage has preferential matchmaking against other flawless players so those of you who thought matchmaking got harder after going flawless on friday saturday even though the flawless pool wasn t on you were right we are planning a fix in for this in the next few weeks this weekend is off for iron banner but the next few weekends will be back to standard elimination with the flawless pool starting sunday at am we know shaking it up every weekend has been a bit jarring and are looking to keep some consistency in the weeks ahead labs talk the first weekend of trials labs went well we played a lot read a lot of feedback talked to our friends and clanmates and looked at the data analytically the weeks looked very similar and matches were slightly more competitive as players grappled with the new ruleset experientially there are some changes we are looking at to make the mode better find a different way to vary the capture zone location without giving positional advantage to either side internally we initially tested a single central zone but found that it created dull repetitive games as it always collapsed the usable map space to that central location the current method uses the central tiebreaker position as center and a c positions from control during advantage rounds we used those points to get the mode into testing quicker but unfortunately that had the side effect of giving one side an advantage we liked the dynamism that created when we playtested internally and that might be a good mechanism in a less competitive mode but we heard you loud and clear that significant of an advantage is too much for trials of osiris we are looking at authoring additional neutral capture locations in a few maps to support further labs this season we may still play around with a milder advantage position to use in extreme cases depending on the map but we want to make sure we have at least three neutral locations remove the gain super energy on capture from the capture zone this specifically after an elimination leads to more snowballing these changes are going to need more work and playtesting than the changes we have been making so far we are looking to get something ready for another run at trials labs capture zone as early as december disability awareness at bungie we believe that everyone should be able to play our games regardless of a barrier or disability they may have october is disability history month and national disability employment awareness month in the united states which is held annually to increase awareness and understanding of

here s a quick recap of what s coming the grandmaster catch-up node will become available at the same time grandmaster difficulty is available so long as you have the conqueror title but have not yet gilded it this season grandmasters will have already gone live by the time this change comes later in the season but the catch-up node will be available when grandmasters first start in seasons going forward each grandmaster nightfall will be available if the fireteam leader has not completed the gilding triumph for that strike during the season in other words you may play each featured strike for a season to earn your gilded title once you ve gilded your title the catch-up node will no longer be available in terms of loot there aren t any major changes happening completing grandmaster nightfalls gives you the chance to earn adept variants of nightfall specific weapons such as the palindrome hand cannon or the newly released hothead rocket launcher players may also earn enhancement

       " Document(page_content=\"this week at bungie we are heading to the lab tomorrow we are kicking off our first trials labs these experimental weekends will allow us to test out targeted changes to the game mode and collect data and feedback on what works and what should remain an abomination of science in keeping with our trials revamp this season we are sticking to our test and learn mindset not only with labs but also with matchmaking rewards and other quality of life improvements this week the normal trials of osiris playlist is replaced with trials labs capture zone this new mode is still elimination with the following changes seconds after the round starts a capture zone is enabled players can capture this zone to win the round or just eliminate the other team like normal the capture zone has a waypoint from round start including a countdown timer so everyone will know exactly when and where it will be the capture zone starts in the middle of the map in the first round and changes location each round the team who just lost gets the advantaged spawn location also for this week double trials rank points for every match if you are feeling the blues of fabled and mythic this is a great week to reset are you flawless we tried something new for trials this past weekend something that has been requested in feedback since trials launched back in destiny we tested out separating off flawless players and their fireteams from players who hadn't yet gone flawless that week before we discuss what to expect this week and in the future we'd like to talk about the goals we have for matchmaking in trials of osiris and look at some key data points for the first two weeks one of the main changes we made with trials this season was to allow solo and duo players to queue up this had two main benefits it allowed players a low barrier of entry and expectation to try the mode out and more importantly it increased the population enough that fireteams of mid-skilled players landed more wins than if they only matched against other mid-skilled or high-skilled teams solo players are a key to the entire system working for example in our first week a whopping were full fireteams vs solos duos cut to this week where only were fireteams vs solos duos -- a pretty sharp drop to get enough solo players in we need to offer rewards that are good enough and matchmaking that feels reasonable regardless of skill level right now we have engrams that you can grind for as well as attractive seven-win rewards but only if you win keep solo players playing we learned a lot from the first two weeks of solo matchmaking week solo wins of games blowouts - losses of games most worryingly the blowout rate for solo players went steadily up over the weekend but then in the second weekend the matchmaking changes pushed that rate back down week solo wins of games blowouts - losses of games this feels a lot better for solo players but obviously it had some side effects for fireteams of mid-to-high skill long-term we are looking to keep the solo win-rate above and solo-fireteam blowouts under keep game quality high make sure more matches feel competitive especially at seven wins we talked about blowouts as one way of looking for competitive matches we also consider - matches as non-competitive the sweet spot is really between - and - those matches tend to feel good while playing even if you end up losing in week we saw of matches end at either - or - in week the number of non-competitive matches dropped to -- a nice improvement but we would like to see this number drop to - over the long-term keep matchmaking times low one of our biggest goals is to keep matchmaking times low while still getting matches with good connections and a competitive outcome we always keep an eye on matchmaking times whenever we make serious changes to the matchmaking landscape in both weeks average matchmaking times were pretty steady at just under seconds per match the only reason it was even that high was because players who started off on a terrible streak would end up in a matchmaking pool below the base pool that only looked for other players who had started off losing rounds in a row it s a very small pool with matchmaking times that last over four minutes before the system gives up and expands back to the base pool we are going to be adjusting how the matchmaking help applies so no one gets stuck in the smaller matchmaking pool going forward other things that worked we had just over k players this weekend only k fewer players than week this is higher than expected given a normal drop-off after launch combined with distant shore being a less popular map plus we had k players go flawless games were longer mostly due to more competitive games things that didn't work we saw less matches played overall and the number of matches post-flawless dropped by we had reports of significant numbers of players resetting - or - cards but we saw around k total cards that were reset while flawless but under seven wins given the vast number of games and cards played m cards started this week this isn't a lot but it is something we are watching as it is unhealthy for the mode if it becomes more common normally we see nearly of the players who go flawless doing so with someone else who is already flawless last week it was this can either be a traditional carry or just playing with friends that number dropped to this week which is unacceptably low for 'friendgame' content to address this we are making two changes in week we are waiting until the sunday morning reset am pt to enable the flawless pool this serves as a middle ground between week and week and as the semi-permanent placement for enabling the flawless pool as always we will be looking at both analytics and feedback so keep telling us what is working and what isn t we are working on some deeper matchmaking solutions which we hope lets us remove the flawless pool look out for more info in mid late october we are turning off matchmaking help until you have played at least two matches during the weekend in addition to the previously announced changes players will no longer get special ammo replenished when being revived adding hold functionality to purchase gear from saint- to prevent accidental purchases weapons received from the reputation rank reward track on saint- will now have their masterwork slots active previous weapons obtained won t receive a masterwork slot unfortunately while we previously announced that we would be removing the matchmaking counter for this week this change wasn t quite able to make the patch looking further forward we expect to take another swing at matchmaking to keep some of the solo lower skill protections from week without strongly negatively affecting flawless players we are looking at adjustments to rewards for round and match wins on seven-win cards other than that updates and trials twab reports will be less common as we get trials into a more stable state iron banner is back next week so after trials labs capture zone trials takes a week off and will return october on

some questions about the new cobalt clash flawless shader and why it s showing up in collections design lead josh kulinski has stepped up to the mic to share some answers josh hey guardians i m here to answer questions about flawless shaders such as cobalt clash one of the shaders that can drop on gear obtained from the lighthouse when going flawless in trials of osiris like vizier regalia before it these shaders are single-use shaders that come pre-equipped on gear obtained from the lighthouse we currently have a collections entry for cobalt clash which states the source as complete a flawless trials ticket while this is the means by which players gain access to gear with the shader applied to it we were not specific enough with our wording here as these shaders are bound to the gear and not unlocked for use on all items like other shaders in the game we apologize for the confusion and will be removing the collections entry furthermore we realize that this is not an ideal player experience and we will be reevaluating how we distribute special shaders like this in the future known issues while we continue investigating various known issues here is a list of the latest

save lives into the void starting in the witch queen we ll be aiming to give light classes the stasis treatment season over season bringing more customization to guardians and new ways to engage with their abilities while the team is still deep in development sandbox discipline lead kevin yanes and gameplay designer samuel dunn are joining us to walk through their goals for abilities and what the upcoming reworks will bring to the table kevin hey everyone kevin from the abilities team here to share some sweet details about what s coming next by the time this gets posted i assume you all have had the opportunity to see what s cooking here in the bungie digital kitchens the world characters and story are all moving forward and things are changing big time destiny is evolving and that means the sandbox needs to evolve with it previously i laid out a roadmap of changes that got us to season with some vague hints about the future now that we re here i wanted to plant more flags in the ground about where we re going next straight to business throughout tuesday s reveal we watched as you all reacted to the witch queen season of the lost and th anniversary part of those reactions where on subjects like subclasses and stasis aspects and fragments i feel that before we move forward we should rip a few bandages off there will be no new darkness subclass with the witch queen or through year we made the call to refocus ourselves on light subclasses this year as you ll see below this doesn t just mean a port but also new and exciting stuff too there are no new stasis aspects and fragments arriving along season of the lost similar to above we wanted to focus on different initiatives instead of adding more to stasis we feel like the subclass build variety is in a good spot and was likely to benefit from tuning changes more than new stuff to that end we prioritized the season of the lost balance patch and another patch you ll hear about below debuting with th anniversary combat reforged today you re going to read a quick tease on a feature we re calling void a new interpretation of the void subclasses and fantasies in the coming weeks you ll hear about changes we re making to how players regenerate ability energy and how those changes are going to affect pve and pvp with our th anniversary release a few examples of changes in the pipe a reduction to how many one shot kill abilities are available in the crucible and shifting super energy regeneration so players are rewarded for participating in combat vs waiting for a timer later in year we hope to share more info on an initiative the team is discussing internally right now making ammo generation a more deterministic and consistently paced experience across all activities i hope what i'm describing here paints a clear picture the game is evolving for the better destiny is a living game and as we head into our fifth year we re looking at how we can evolve the sandbox you know and love to not only create exciting new experiences but to better polish ones that haven t had much love since our launch in we ve learned a lot over the years with each iteration of the sandbox and we re hoping to apply those learnings through year and beyond i hope you are all as excited about the future as i am brave new world as you saw in our reveal event we re going to be doing serious revamps to the existing light subclasses in destiny our void solar and arc subclasses and damage types have been with destiny from the very beginning in fact some of the player fantasies and mechanics in destiny today are the same that debuted with destiny back in and while we ve had refreshes in and with destiny and forsaken these subclasses have in some cases been left behind by the new power bar and build-crafting goals of the game to help solve that problem we re going to take these subclasses back into the shop to retrofit remix and reinterpret the gameplay fantasies and mechanics by integrating them into the modern subclass experience in destiny beyond light we introduced a new subclass system we dubbed internally as subclass the goals of subclass were to create an experience that gave players more customization akin to destiny while also meaningfully evolving that experience to us destiny is best when build-crafting best-in-class action and power fantasy all meet to create gameplay experiences you can t get anywhere else staring out into the void with void we re taking the subclasses you know and love and remixing them that means adding new abilities and mechanics ditching some old ones where it makes sense to do so and spreading out existing ones to create enticing new combinations our hope is to retain playstyles you know and love today and to create some exciting new ones you didn t even know you wanted we can t wait to see what you all think about these changes and as always we re going to be looking for and responding to feedback with that all said and done i am going bow out and let the team do the talking sam howdy everyone i'm sam dunn abilities designer on the sandbox team i m here to dive into a little more detail about what you can expect from void a new shape as kevin detailed above we re in the process of updating void solar and arc into the new subclass system used by stasis where you can pick and choose from a selection of supers grenades melees and aspects and fragments to craft cool and unique builds tailored around your playstyle in the witch queen you ll experience the first phase of this metamorphosis as you wield the powers of the void in your fight against savath n and her lucent brood it s important to reiterate that this update will change things destiny has evolved significantly in the three years since forsaken and we believe that the light subclasses need a shakeup to keep pace much of the void gameplay that you know and love will continue to exist albeit in a different form a few things won t be returning and there are some exciting new additions we think you ll have a blast with to paint the picture of how we re approaching the void rework here are our main goals preserve the strong existing power fantasies of void we want to focus on what makes the damage type fun to use and give it a cohesive identity that can be felt throughout your subclass while also adding sweet new toys that feel like a natural extension of your void powers provide new and exciting build-crafting possibilities through the combination of aspects and fragments we want you to not only be able to craft similar playstyles to the old subclass diamonds using the new system but also to explore a bunch of new ways that your void abilities can work together with your armor and weapons set up a framework for the systemic integration of the damage type into the rest of the game we believe that stasis was very successful in providing a set of shared combat behaviors or verbs that can interact with each other and with other elements in the game with void we want to double down on this effort and reorganize the subclasses in a similar way and we re planning to continue this with solar and arc going forward say the key word with the void update we re defining a set of core keywords that will be used by the various perks and abilities within each void subclass akin to the slow freeze and shatter verbs used by stasis each class will specialize in a few of these verbs but it will be possible to dabble in the rest by coordinating with your fireteam or with certain combinations of abilities and fragments additionally these verbs will appear in other places outside of the subclass screen weapon perks exotic armor and mods from your seasonal artifact and we intend to continue expanding that list as we move forward we believe that these systemic interactions between your abilities and your gear are the core of the destiny buildcrafting game within void there are three negative status effects that you ll be applying to enemies suppression the target is knocked out of any active abilities and can t activate any abilities movement modes as long as suppression persists afflicted enemy ai combatants can t shoot their weapons weaken the target takes increased damage and has their movement slowed enemy ai combatants fire their weapons with decreased accuracy volatile the target is afflicted with unstable void energy and will explode upon taking additional damage or on death and three positive effects that you ll be applying to yourself and allies void overshield a protective barrier of void light which reduces damage taken from combatants invisibility you vanish from sight and do not appear on enemy radar devour you feast on the energy of your foes kills restore you to full health grant grenade energy and extend devour these verbs should all be familiar to veteran players but now exist in a new broader systemic framework that will allow us to consistently spread their behaviors across the game where previously they mostly existed in their own siloed-off subclasses old dogs new tricks to close this section out here s a preview of some of the new and updated abilities that you ll be able to play with once void drops nightstalker huntershadowshot moebius quiver super fire two volleys of three void arrows in a cone which seek out enemies and spawn void anchors on impact shadowshot makes tethered enemies volatile and deals increased damage to tethered targets one of the main usability pain points of the current iteration of moebius quiver is having to press the super input a whole bunch of times to fire each arrow individually which is cumbersome and takes a lot of time and often results in the player drifting somewhere they didn t intend to be off the side of a cliff as a totally hypothetical example by firing multiple arrows at once it should be a lot easier to blanket an area with traps in preparation for a fight or put burst damage on a boss stylish executioner aspect defeating a weakened suppressed or volatile target grants invisibility and truesight after performing a stylish execution your next melee attack while invisible weakens enemies a twist on middle-tree nightstalker s current flawless execution perk this aspect lets the hunter specialize in defeating debuffed enemies to keep looping their invisibility sentinel titanoverwatch aspect cast a void-empowered barricade to grant a void overshield to yourself and nearby allies the empowered barricade slowly regenerates the void overshield of allies bunkering behind it we want players to be able to lean into the sentinel fantasy of being the front-line protector for your team so overwatch is a powerful tool for setting up prior to an encounter and providing a safe haven to fall back to when things get spicy shield toss projectile melee hurl your shield towards an enemy the shield can ricochet off enemies and surfaces granting you a small chunk of void overshield for each enemy hit we want to give titans more options when it comes to projectile melees shield toss is a great choice for aggressively pushing forward into groups of enemies softening them up and giving you extra staying power voidwalker warlockpocket singularity projectile melee launch a tracking unstable ball of void energy that detonates when it nears an enemy pushing targets away from the blast and making them volatile designed as an anti-dive tool and a way to push enemies out of cover with careful placement it s possible and incredibly satisfying to bop enemies up in the air and then pop their volatile with a well-placed headshot before they hit the ground child of the old gods aspect cast your rift to summon a sentient black hole which hovers at your side waiting for a target it will launch itself at enemies then begin siphoning their energy and weakening them refunding their life force back to you as either grenade and melee energy if you are using healing rift or health if you are using empowering rift defeating enemies who are being siphoned by the child will refund some rift energy child of the old gods is a strong debuff tool that gives voidwalkers an additional way to lock down an area while sustaining themselves we hope that this preview sparks your curiosity and gets you thinking about cool new void builds have you ever wanted to run spectral blades and vanishing step ward of dawn and controlled demolition handheld supernova and devour there are a lot of new possibilities and as we get closer to the witch queen we ll be back in future twabs to talk more about the supers fragments and grenades you ll be mixing and matching we re really excited about what we re cooking up and we can t wait for you to get your hands on it in the meantime check out the ability

       " Document(page_content=\"this week at bungie we start shaking up the sandbox welcome to the twab we ve got a lot to cover today so i m going to skip the small talk and get into it yesterday assistant game director and mustache enthusiast joe blackburn went out on twitter and talked about some our upcoming plans regarding destiny pvp ahead of the showcase this month i wanted to take a little time to talk about destiny pvp joe blackburn joegoroth august please give the whole thread a read but for the tl dr crew the main thing we want everyone to know is that we have a plan it's going to take some time and we are excited about the future of creating a more consistent delivery of pvp content each year the best of your ability our teams have been hard at work putting together a lot of changes for next season we decided to break out upcoming sandbox changes into three parts this week we are covering abilities next week we will talk about armor and mods and then we will touch on weapons during the final week before the end of the season here is combat gameplay designer eric smith to give you the rundown on how your guardian s abilities will be evolving next season eric smith hey guardians we ve been hard at work on an abilities balance patch for season but before we get into the balance changes here s some info about a quality-of-life change debuting in season separate melee actions have you ever tried to throw a knife at an approaching screeb only to instead lunge forward and slap the screeb in its gross exploding face have you ever accidentally wasted your hard-earned melee charge on a sad lone dreg if so there s hope introducing separate melee actions starting next season you ll be able to bind your charged melee attack and your uncharged melee attack to separate inputs giving you greater control of when you use your abilities this is an opt-in feature and these new actions will be unbound by default when you go to customize your controls you ll see the following new entries in the action list auto-melee is the new name for the melee action that you re used to your melee is context-sensitive and its behavior will change based on your equipped ability and your proximity to enemies it usually does its job well but will occasionally betray player intent charged melee is a new action that will always activate your charged melee ability upon button press regardless of whether an enemy is in lunge range pressing the input when your melee ability is not fully charged will perform no action and cause the melee-ability icon to flash red similar to how the grenade ability works uncharged melee is a new action that will always activate your uncharged melee even when your charged melee ability is fully charged it s fairly straightforward but here are some things to note melee attacks trigger as soon as the button is pressed not when it s released melee attacks don t wait to see if you re still holding the button before starting this means you can t set any of the melee actions to a long-press or double-press input game controllers have a limited number of inputs so you may need to get creative with how you map your controls personally i like to put charged melee on rb r and uncharged melee on right-stick click r this doubles up the finisher and uncharged-melee actions on right-stick click r which will prioritize finishing enemies over melee-ing them if the enemy is in a finish-able state if you assign charged melee and uncharged melee to the same input it will always prioritize the charged melee over the uncharged melee which is the opposite behavior of the auto-melee action to use these new actions on keyboard mouse open the settings menu click on keyboard mouse scroll down to charged melee and uncharged melee and assign them to an input to use these new actions on controller open the settings menu go to controller - button layout - custom scroll down to charged melee and uncharged melee and assign them to an input we hope you enjoy this new functionality and we hope it saves your bacon from time to time long-term ability plans last season sandbox lead kevin yanes laid out our vision for how we see subclass abilities fitting into the destiny sandbox moving forward our philosophy for ability design is that abilities should complement the core combat of destiny but not dominate it it should enhance the game s gunplay but not replace it the changes we re introducing in season will help set the stage for those larger systemic ability changes in the coming seasons we ll be focusing on adjusting how often abilities can be used in the crucible specifically please stay tuned for more info about that season ability balance pass for season we ve prepared a slew of balance changes to raise up underperforming subclasses and tone down overperforming subclasses without further ado here are the ability changes we ll be making in season general abilities stasis freeze the goal of these changes is to make being frozen by stasis less frustrating previously players who were frozen in the air had to wait until they hit the ground to start the breakout process additionally we ve shortened the window of vulnerability between breaking out of the stasis encasement and losing the damage resistance it provides and getting back to weapon ready so you can fight back frozen players can now initiate breakout while airborne shortened breakout animation and camera transition this means that once you decide to break out you ll be able to fight back sooner differentiated long freeze and short freeze visual treatment to make each status easier to identify slide the goal of this slide change is to slightly reduce the effectiveness of sliding into engagements to gain the upper hand even after the shotgun changes we made last season sliding into every engagement with a shotgun or any weapon is still incredibly effective and run-and-gun playstyles are very low-risk this is a change that looks scarier on paper than it feels in practice in our opinion and we ll continue to monitor how it plays out while sliding players now incur the following weapon penalties - stability shotgun pellet spread x flinch titan rally barricade this barricade variant doesn t see much use so we've made changes to make it a more viable option it retains the same reload-speed benefits as before while adding other weapon buffs standing behind the rally barricade now also provides the following weapon buffs stability range - flinch all barricades currently certain fast-moving abilities allow you to speed through an enemy barricade while taking minimal damage the goal of this change is to make players think twice before dashing through a barricade to engage the titan on the other side barricades still can t cause lethal damage but dashing through one should now always leave you with a sliver of health players moving at high velocity now take more damage when moving through hostile titan barricades barricades now slightly protrude into the ground to better protect the titan's feet on uneven ground this should reduce instances where explosions and projectiles are able to sneak through the bottom of the barricade and hit the titan behemoth as you may remember midway through last season we released a portion of the stasis-related changes originally intended for this releasen we re pretty happy with the effect those changes have had on the crucible but some of the changes we made had a negative effect on the feel of stasis in pve content we ve made some adjustments that should help these abilities feel better in this case the cryoclasm change we made last season made it difficult to use cryoclasm to shatter targets that were close to you this change enables the behemoth to shatter nearby targets even if they don t have enough space to get a running start we also believe we overdid the movement-speed nerf to behemoths last season which hurt the viability of shiver strike especially during the glacial quake super we ve increased the movement speed to make this feel better with this patch we are also fixing a bug where the whisper of rime overshield wasn t properly scaling precision damage causing it to be significantly beefier than intended which primarily impacted tectonic harvest behemoths cryoclasm while equipped base slide now shatters crystals and frozen enemies increased duration of screen fx notifying players that cryoclasm long slide is ready from second to seconds shiver strike increased movement speed by whisper of rime fixed a bug where the overshield provided by whisper of rime was not scaling precision damage correctly middle-tree sunbreaker we are extending the throwing hammer lifespan to allow titans more time to finish an engagement and still pick up their hammer before it vanishes we also felt it could deal more damage against orange- and yellow-bar enemies also the new charged melee action allows you to throw your hammer point-blank at an enemy which is pretty badass throwing hammer increased time before hammer explodes after hitting the ground from s to s increased damage vs powerful pve combatants by top-and-bottom-tree striker some of the game s melee-based supers are at a bit of a disadvantage in today s sandbox so we ve decided to give a few of them some love in the future we ll be looking at ways to reduce the disparity between melee supers and ranged supers in a more sustainable way fists of havoc increased slam detonation radius by reduced slam damage falloff reduced slam attack activation cost from to middle-tree striker this change will be balanced out by something we haven t mentioned yet we ll say more about this in a future twab inertia override increased duration from seconds to seconds sliding over an ammo brick now grants melee energy top-tree sentinel the following change refers to the ward of dawn bubble itself and not players inside the bubble currently dropping a ward of dawn on top of a boss is a no-brainer because it s so effective the goal of this change is to reduce the breadth of encounters solved by ward of dawn and make burly bubbles a conscious choice by the titan ward of dawn increased damage taken from bosses from x - x at resilience damage taken can scale down to x based on the owner's resilience stat hunter revenant last season we reduced the radius of the silence freeze that change has played out well requiring the revenant to be more precise with their silence throws even now silence feels like the scarier part of the super and we want squall to feel more dangerous currently the squall storm is slow enough that you can kind of ignore it or fight until it gets close and then relocate with this speed change we want players to prioritize relocating when they see an approaching squall additionally squall will now stop when it touches a boss which should make it better for single-target boss damage however there s a known issue where the squall will not start moving again if the boss moves or dies we hope to further improve this behavior in a future release we feel we hit withering blade slightly too hard in last season s stasis balancing the following change should make it slightly easier to land while keeping the damage and slow duration at a reasonable spot silence and squall increased squall movement speed by squall storm now stops when it touches a boss withering blade increased projectile speed and tracking by middle-tree gunslinger we'd like to give hunters a larger window to defeat burning enemies and trigger the playing with fire perk as such we re giving the knife trick timer a buff knife trick increased burning duration from s to s top-tree gunslinger this super has been through a lot we had intentionally reduced the effective range of six-shooter several seasons ago to balance it against bottom-tree golden gun this change was then unintentionally reverted at some point due to an unrelated integration mishap and then later de-reverted in any case we re extending the lethal range of this super a little to reduce how often it required two shots to kill in the crucible six-shooter damage falloff now starts at m instead of m arcstrider as we mentioned previously melee supers such as arc staff are struggling a bit in today s sandbox where players move extremely fast weapons hit extremely hard and ranged supers handily win duels we ve extended the duration and slam range to help alleviate some of arc staff s shortcomings but we ll continue to evaluate super dynamics and search for a solution that doesn t cause power creep additionally arc staff needed a little love in high-level pve content so we ve increased its damage output there arc staff extended passive super duration from seconds to seconds increased heavy-slam detonation radius from m to m increased damage vs pve combatants by top-tree arcstrider deadly reach increased duration from seconds to seconds middle-tree arcstrider lightning weave dealing damage with tempest strike now triggers lightning weave timer can now be extended by dealing damage with any weapon middle-tree nightstalker spectral blades not only allows its user to go invisible and vanish from radar but also has one of the highest damage-reduction values in the game as the fantasy of this ability is that of a stealthy assassin and not a stealthy raid boss we ve decided to tone down the damage reduction looking at the data middle-tree nightstalker is among the most successful subclasses in the crucible so this change feels warranted spectral blades reduced damage reduction during super from to reduced additional dr when invisible from to warlock shadebinder winter s wrath is one of the best dueling supers in the game capable of quickly and easily dispatching other supers we re ok with that being a strength of the shadebinder in pvp but we felt melee supers needed more of a fighting chance against the shadebinder winter's wrath reduced shatterpulse damage vs close-range supers warlock must now freeze and shatter twice to defeat players in burning maul fists of havoc sentinel shield nova warp arc staff or spectral blades glacial quake still only requires one shatter to defeat top-tree dawnblade top-tree dawnblade ttd is straight-up dominant in pvp so we re taking some measures to make it slightly less so celestial fire will now take a little more accuracy to get full damage having access to two back-to-back icarus dashes gave this subclass too much positioning flexibility allowing for quick long-distance flanking and evasion when playing against a ttd it s hard to know if they have an icarus dash ready to go even if you just saw them use one we re hoping this change makes playing against a ttd more predictable we want the identity of ttd to be found in aerial combat so we re doubling down on heat rises we hope this change makes heat rises more accessible to players of all skill levels celestial fire reduced tracking cone angle arming shape proximity detonation now shrinks over time reduced detonation size by m damage falloff increased at short distances icarus dash now provides one air dodge every seconds while under the effects of heat rises increased to dodges every seconds heat rises increased duration from seconds to seconds increased the time extension awarded for air kills while heat rises is active the extension duration differs based on the type of enemy killed your location now appears on enemy radar when using heat rises middle-tree dawnblade like ward of dawn dropping a well on certain bosses is a no-brainer because it s so effective the goal of the below changes is to reduce the breadth of encounters solved by well of radiance and make burly wells a conscious choice by the warlock additionally we d like to make well of radiance more effective in the crucible you will have more survivability while in the well and you won t be able to be frozen or slowed by stasis users making this tree a solid choice when facing off against stasis the well sword can be frozen and shattered but it takes multiple freezes and shatters before being destroyed well of radiance increased damage taken from bosses from x x at resilience damage taken can scale down to x based on the owner's resilience stat note this refers to the well of radiance itself and not players inside the well increased damage resistance buff vs enemy players from to players inside well of radiance are now immune to stasis freeze and slow well sword can now be frozen and shattered by stasis guiding flame increased duration from seconds to seconds increased damage buff from to bottom-tree dawnblade this tree has felt a little lackluster when compared to the warlock s other options so we ve given it some enhanced functionality like the revenant s shatterdive phoenix dive can now dive down diagonally in the direction of your choosing bottom-tree dawnblade also has one of the weaker melee attacks in the game you had to defeat an enemy with the melee impact to cause an explosion with this new rework any time you defeat an enemy who is burning or defeat an enemy with any of your solar abilities they ll explode and put a burn on nearby enemies your charged melee deals damage and puts a burn on the enemy meaning you can follow up with another lethal attack and still get the explosion as a side note this will be even more effective with the dawn chorus exotic helmet phoenix dive reduced delay before dive starts can now input a direction to dive in that direction igniting touch ability rework solar ability kills and kills on burning targets now cause targets to explode and burn other nearby enemies who will also explode if they die while burning middle-tree stormcallerthese changes should lead to less instances of chaos reach dealing damage to enemies on the other side of a wall arc beam sees high use in the crucible in part due to geomag stabilizers and is often used as a shutdown super in future seasons we ll be looking at arc beam to make sure it s not too easy to use in the crucible chaos reach increased beam environment-collision size to better match collision size with damage size reduced beam damage radius in pvp by reduced beam end-point-sphere radius in pvp by bottom-tree stormcaller player feedback and data on bottom-tree stormcaller indicated it could use a little love so we made arc soul last a little longer and slightly shortened the time between bursts landfall felt a little underwhelming so we increased the spectacle a bit it will now fire five arc projectiles along the ground in all directions cast your super in the middle of a room to electrocute everything around you arc soul increased duration from seconds to seconds increased fire rate by electrostatic surge now increases sprint speed when allies are near landfall now fires five arc ground projectiles on cast middle-tree voidwalker through a mix of player feedback data and running through some high-level pve content we felt the nova warp super needed some attention buffing nova warp is a dangerous endeavor though and we ll be monitoring to make sure we didn t overdo it in pve handheld supernova was doing a pitiful amount of damage so we ve considerably increased its damage output especially considering the time and proximity cost you re paying to charge it up and get within range of an enemy we ve also increased the hold time after charging to give you more time to throw it before it vanishes nova warp increased damage vs pve combatants by no longer slows movement speed while charging charged now detonates on cast handheld supernova increased damage vs pve combatants by increased hold time from seconds to seconds phew we ve omitted some minor changes and bug fixes from this list to avoid bogging down the twab any more than we already have for the full list of ability changes be sure to check out the patch notes when season launches while this season s changes are focused on balancing the power output of specific abilities we re hard at work on system-level changes that will enable us to create a healthier balance between abilities and gunplay we hope to share more about those changes in the future later improving the powering-up stasis experience with beyond light guardians received their first taste of wielding the powers of darkness as well as a new way to power-up sub-classes with aspects and fragments these sub-class mods introduced a new way of evolving and growing a sub-class which drastically impacts how the stasis sub-class felt guardians who used aspects and fragments experience the true power of stasis whereas those who have not may feel a bit cold toward it even worse many guardians may not even know of the extended power offered by aspects and fragments and we wanted to improve that starting in season our darkness guide on europa the exo stranger will now reveal more information on how to complete the tasks required for earning more stasis power guardians who have finished the beyond light campaign and visit the exo stranger on europa will see the entire path for unlocking aspects and fragments additionally many of the pre-requirements for obtaining and completing the born in darkness quest chain will be reduced or removed previously guardians needed to complete several quest chains and unlock salvation s grip before stasis would grant them additional power guardians that completed the beyond light campaign will have immediate access to the born in darkness quest chain from the exo stranger on europa the exo stranger also reveals every unowned fragment regardless of progression through the born in darkness questline giving a preview of the many powers to unlock with these improvements to messaging aimed at removing a lot of the mystery around powering-up stasis we re excited to see more guardians unlock stasis s chilling power the gauntlet this year marks our th

       " Document(page_content=\"this week at bungie we begin to prepare for cross play welcome to another installment of the twab we have four more of these before the august reveal wait a second we only have four including this one oh wow we have a bit to get through let s start with something that s going on in the game right now solstice of heroes our annual solstice event is coming to an end next tuesday august you have a little under five days to complete your armor objectives white glows don t have a deadline so if you re still gathering orbs and objectives take your time dungeons raids and competitive crucible objectives for the glows can be completed any time still with me cool let s start looking at the future we hosted a beta for this a few months back but we re happy to share more details about an upcoming feature that players have been asking for since destiny first arrived cross play cross play is coming in season cross play comes to life guardians across xbox playstation pc and stadia will be able to join fireteams to take on the darkness together boundaries will be broken and new friendships will be forged no matter the platform as we prepare for liftoff the cross play team is providing a quick tour of cross play how do you add friends how will matchmaking work what will the ui look like a bunch of answers will be found below we ll have a few images to help guide you through the user interface so you know what to expect at launch note these previews will be in english but the cross play ui will include all supported languages without further ado let s dive in cross play team there are big changes afoot so big that i recommend getting a snack before starting this read back already okay here we go this is what we're going to cover your guardian's identity naming changes bungie friends fireteam invites and multiplayer privacy cross play matchmaking cross play communication the cross play roadmap but first you deserve a thank you early during season we crossed the platform streams and invited you to participate in a three-day vanguard strikes cross play matchmaking beta our goals were to prove early versions of our matchmaking changes as well as test out connectivity for gameplay between the platforms numerous guardians answered the call and helped us test out the backend of this upcoming feature as it turned out we may have accidentally left an unintended door open oops even though we had to shut that down we weren't the only ones who were delighted to finally hug our long-lost cross-platform friends in-game thank you for going on this journey with us you helped build confidence in what we're delivering to the community in season full cross play across all destiny platforms who am i in a cross play world that also supports cross save it quickly became clear to us that we had a guardian identity crisis we didn't want the name over your guardian's head to change based on where you logged into the game we felt this fought against the fantasy of who you are in this new unified destiny community even more concerning we didn't want the names of your friends and clan mates to change based on where they logged into the game having to keep a who's-who cheat sheet of your friends names didn't meet our effortless bar for cross play as such we're converting everyone's name over to an identity that will remain consistent across all platforms you play from we re calling this your bungie name while this will cause a one-time naming reshuffle we feel this is better for everyone in the long run here s how bungie names will work and look bungie name playername display name playername hash numeric id here's an example of a player tooltip in the roster screen surrounded by players from different platforms and an example of what players will look like in the tower what's in a name as part of the creation of bungie names we will be running all player names through a character filtration process and an offensive term moderation process first we will be stripping out all characters that we are unable to display in the game or that can't be typed into the player search box via console virtual keyboards this means some of the extended character sets we've supported for player names on steam will no longer be able to be used we will miss you fellow guardian hand cannon sniper rifle rocket launcher but we do want your console friends to be able to find you via player search it is possible that due to removing these characters players will end up with empty names or names that result in offensive terms if your name ends up empty or includes a moderated term you will find the quite unremarkable guardian random number name over your character s head while we won t have a name change feature at launch we are working diligently to get you an early version of this feature this winter we highly recommend you think carefully about what name you d like to rock in destiny sooner rather than later as we don t want you to be stuck with a handle you re not overly fond of when the name change feature goes live you've got friends in me the bungie roster experience has always been an essential part of our games for cross play we wanted to deliver that same simple experience no matter where your friends might be playing to make this happen we created a system to bridge the platforms called bungie friends now we didn't want to add considerable complexity so you'll still find all of your friends in one flat list to make it a bit easier to find a specific friend we've also added a platform filter you can still see just the friends who are logged into the same platform as you you've always been able to have clan members across multiple platforms in destiny but finally with the launch of cross play you'll be able to see everyone who's online and team up to go earn your clan rewards hopefully there are some new friends to be made in your clan the one where you find your friends cross play without an easy way to add new friends well doesn't get it done as such there are three different ways to add your friends from all platforms to your bungie friends log into destiny on a device where you want to turn platform friends into bungie friends and then issue requests via our roster screen search for your friends using player search on the invite screen use bungie net friends finder where you can link all of your platforms and then issue bungie friends requests to all your platform friends the bungie net friend finder will become available alongside cross play and will be found at https www bungie net friends so let's talk about the in-game options have friends will fireteam in order to make fireteam invites work across all platforms we've pulled all of the invite infrastructure into the game when you get a fireteam invite you'll see an in-game invite notification to accept the invite you'll navigate to the roster screen then the invite section and then interact with the invite to accept and join your fireteam notice that the invite screen is where you can search for other guardians accept friend requests and clan invites teaming up with potential new friends destiny is a game filled with aspirational content to help players find each other our community has built a series of external group finding forums and tools including our own fireteam finder which can now issue fireteam invites to all platforms when building cross play we wanted to make sure that our new fireteam invite system wasn't getting in the way to pulling together your fireteam as such the invite screen allows for players to search for each other and issue fireteam invites that said there are members of our community who experience targeted harassment to help players protect themselves we've added a block system so that players can protect themselves we've also added additional privacy tools so that players can protect themselves from broad harassment most of the social privacy settings can be accessed from the roster screen where you will have control over the different kinds of invites you're willing to see and consider for the time being your privacy setting for clan invites will still be controlled through your personal bungie net privacy settings which can be found here https www bungie net en profile settings category privacy while we re on the subject now is a good time to remind everyone of our code of conduct targeted harassment can result in account restrictions and bans be kind to each other guardians a level playing field in cross play we're striving to create a global community of guardians at the same time cross play enabled us to ask a ton of questions about input methods and how we create a level playing field in competitive modes while the following might not be the answer forever it will be our approach for matchmaking in competitive modes crucible iron banner trials gambit at cross play launch pc players will match with other pc players console players will match with other console players note stadia will be in the console pool fireteams with any combination of pc players and console players will match in the pc player pool for pve modes there will be one global matchmaking pool chatting with your friends when cross play releases voice chat between platforms will not be enabled we have run into some late-breaking issues with development and are currently working on making sure this experience is ready before shipping it live we know this will create a less-than-ideal player experience out of the gate and we even considered delaying cross play as a whole since we know that there is a lot of excitement and that the community will find ways to work around this in the interim we decided to go ahead with the launch we're currently targeting a fix for cross-platform voice chat in an update targeted for shortly after cross play goes live we see text chat as a critical tool for player communication in our action mmo game at cross play launch text chat will still be available on steam from launch through the witch queen we'll add text chat support across the console platforms we'll start with displaying text so that console players can at least see what their pc friends are talking about and then we will add usb keyboard support so that everyone can join in note usb keyboards on consoles will only be for chat and will not be able to control your character launch is just the beginning cross play launch isn't the end of our ambition there are a number of improvements we'll be bringing to the social experience of cross play leading up to the witch queen early season bungie name and bungie friends cross platform invites multiplayer and matchmaking player search and social privacy soon after launch - cross platform voice chat winter - bungie name changes winter - text chat display on consoles winter - text input via usb keyboards on consoles till we see each other again using cross play we're excited to gather all guardians into one global community a lot of us play on different devices and have friends coworkers and clanmates that we haven t played with in years we can t wait to hop into a raid or clear some gm nightfalls with long lost friends as always we'll be listening across all of our channels for feedback thank you and we can't wait for you to jump in and let us know what you think the cross play team so there is one burning question we didn t answer here when exactly does cross play go live the team is working hard to dot the i's and cross the t s stay tuned and we ll let you know when the date is locked in flying the banner one last time this season lord saladin returns next week to host the final iron banner of

a constant anyway solstice of heroes is going strong have you upgraded your armor yet next week is the final week of the event so go check out the eaz and earn that armor before the event ends on we had a lot to go over last week with a preview of ritual reputation changes coming next season it s a little lighter this week but we do have some important info about the new bungie store and some changes to armor synthesis let s get to it unraveling the synthstrands since the launch of season of the splicer we have been monitoring reception and behavior around our new armor synthesis system today we d like to review a minor update around the system s currencies effective at the start of season we will deprecate the passively-earned world currency synthstrand that was used to purchase armor synthesis bounties from ada- in its place these bounties will be purchasable for glimmer instead our hope is that this change reduces the time needed to earn your synthweave tokens per class each season removing this currency also frees up a slot in the consumables inventory bucket a bucket that could be full for those of you carrying around a large quantity of items finally we hope this change reduces the complexity of the armor synthesis system with only one remaining currency for each class that can be immediately turned in at ada- s loom for a synthweave token we ll continue to monitor the conversation and use of armor synthesis as season rolls out in the meantime keep showing us your new looks the team is inspired and delighted by the incredible creativity they've seen from

bit going on a larger than usual mid-season sandbox update vault of glass master difficulty and more let s dig in fatebreakers raids fall squarely into the endgame space of destiny providing aspirational content for fireteams of six to conquer once you ve climbed the mountain and planted your flag you may find yourself asking what s next well i m here today to let you know that you haven

vault of glass will also introduce timelost weapons to destiny timelost weapons can be comparable to adept weaponry from grandmaster nightfalls or flawless trials passages but offer an additional perk in columns three and four for slightly more customization complete vault of glass challenges in the master difficulty of the activity and you will be rewarded each week will feature a specific timelost weapon for you to hunt rotating alongside the available challenge once you ve earned a timelost weapon you may also purchase additional rolls from the chest at the end of the raid on master difficulty using spoils of conquest note that these will be at a higher price than normal versions of these weapons please note weekly reward lockouts are shared between both normal and master difficulties of vault of glass that means encounters challenges and hidden chests will only award gear the first time you complete them in either activity each week they must be completed at master difficulty first to earn timelost weapons and stat-focused armor lastly armor from the master difficulty of vault of glass will focus on specific stats rotating weekly if you ve been hunting a prime

do that is in the iron banner it s active right now so make sure to complete those bounties for additional pinnacle rewards as you prepare for the raid atheon will be seeing you next week good luck to all fireteams as they attempt their first master difficulty raid shifting sands mid-season sandbox update over the last few seasons we ve seen some pretty big changes to the destiny sandbox aggressive hand cannons jumped into the spotlight of pvp rocket launchers became an awesome option for pve content dead man s tale started whistling in the wind and much more over the last few months the team has been working to prepare a mid-season sandbox pass much larger than ones we ve shipped in the past to give you all of the details weapons feature lead chris proctor has once again agreed to lend some time to the twab chris hey all chris here i d first like to set some expectations normally we wouldn't make large changes in a mid-season patch but with a handful of weapons sucking all the air out of the room we decided to bring some changes originally planned for season into next week s update we'll follow this up with a big set of changes in season moving these changes up to season of the splicer also gives us the option of doing some reactive tuning in season s mid-season patch all in all we'll continue to make changes outside of seasonal updates when we can but they won't typically be this large or numerous so without further ado the big-ticket items for pvp are no surprises shotguns rpm aggressive hand cannons and dead man's tale combined these dominate all forms of pvp particularly trials we ve also been getting large amounts of feedback about special weapon usage in the crucible and this will be a first step towards addressing these player concerns ok we can t forget about sleeper simulant in pve too intended special weapon roles in pvp most special weapons should have one situation where they're a dominant choice - if caught outside of this you should be at a disadvantage moving towards these roles is a work in progress some weapons are not where we want them to be and we've made some changes in season of the splicer that we expect to need more adjustments later on note that special ammo abundance in pvp distorts these roles allowing play that wouldn t be possible otherwise and is something we re looking to address here are the roles we intend each special weapon to fill sniper rifles - engaging at long range with aiming skill when not already under fire shotguns - engaging at point blank range using skill at movement or positioning to get close enough to get a one- or two-hit elimination fusion rifles - engaging at mid-range but with careful positioning and pre-charging around cover required for success trace rifles - strong at close to mid-ranges at the cost of not being a one-hit elimination making it possible to be outplayed by skillful primary users grenade launchers - useful for weakening an opponent getting damage around corners with bounces or getting a one-hit elimination with a direct impact at the cost of projectile travel time and being in a bad place if you miss your shot with the single-round magazine let's talk about some weapons shotguns are very dominant in pvp by any measure and don't allow much counterplay with primary weapons particularly close-range primaries like sidearms and smgs we see frequent player feedback about their prevalence in pvp activities and how they make it difficult to use various weapon archetypes that otherwise feel good against players without shotguns we want them to excel in a narrower niche then they do currently so this change aims to retain the reliable one-hit elimination but at closer range and push them to be slightly rangier than currently at getting two-hit eliminations as with our intent for all special weapons if a player is caught out of position with a shotgun they should be at a clear disadvantage with the ability to quickly follow up rising in importance we expect faster-firing shotguns to eat into aggressive shotguns dominance and other special weapons to be more viable increased aggressive frame shotgun cone angle from to degrees reduced shotgun damage falloff min by m increased shotgun damage falloff max by m note slug shotguns are unaffected by this change aggressive rpm hand cannons were adjusted in season of the splicer but this didn't make enough of a difference we believe that they're still too rangy and benefit way too much from a small damage buff two-tapping it's tricky because they're now not much different from their pre-beyond light form they already had better range and a two-tap with rampage but people have latched onto their ease of two and two-tapping potential since the buff in beyond light and new s in season of the chosen encouraged people to try them out with this change we expect other primaries to become viable where previously s ate their lunch including adaptive hand cannons pulse rifles scout rifles and auto rifles while allowing s to keep the advantage of hard-hitting peek shooting at range reduced precision damage multiplier from to preventing a damage bonus from allowing two-tapping in pvp reduced aim assist minimum falloff distance by - m depending on the range stat reduced damage minimum falloff distance by m this reduces their damage falloff advantage over other hand cannons to m as usual this is m before the zoom scalar we also have a few changes to perks drop mag can no longer roll on new drops of weapons will have functionality changed later there's a change coming next season that requires adjusting this and some perks with similar functionality - more on that later pulse monitor fixed an issue where the handling bonus was no longer applying rewind rounds fixed an issue where the perk would not trigger if the last shot in a magazine missed or if the player reloaded another weapon before firing the final shot reservoir burst we've seen the complaints that the detonation on kills doesn't feel that reliable or impactful so this has been updated with the same consistency and speed fix as dragonfly two exotics will get some tuning dead man's tale is dominant on mouse and keyboard receives frequent critical feedback from players in the crucible and is strong but not worryingly so on controller we re keeping the fast-firing in hip which we believe is key to the feel of the weapon but with this change it will no longer have ads levels of damage falloff while hip-firing and so will be subject to falloff much closer it will also require better aim to land hits while hip-firing we re deliberately only lightly touching ease of use in this change with the goal of not making it harder to use on controller removed hip-fire damage falloff scalar was x to match zoom aim assist cone angle hip scalar reduced from to sleeper simulant didn't receive any custom tuning when we updated linear fusion rifles lfr but because it has much higher body damage than other lfrs it didn't benefit as much as intended from the global buff to precision damage scalar sleeper will now be the clear winner for single shot lfr damage edge out other lfrs for burst damage and largely match others for total damage for reserves also note that sleeper's penalty for hitting the body rather than the head is much lower giving it an edge in real world damage fixed an issue where sleeper simulant was benefiting less than other lfrs from the season of the splicer lfr precision damage buff total buff is now compared to the buff other lfrs received the near future we have more changes than usual for a season coming in season some as follow-ups to the above and others that were too large for mid-season here's a preview of some of the changes of course also expect a new batch of weapons and perks fusion rifles we've been wanting to tackle subfamily differentiation for a while so we're planning on a large rework of fusion rifles changes to fusion rifle perks mods and custom tuning to most exotic fusion rifles is vex mythoclast a fusion rifle let s say yes breech grenade launchers with the above shotgun changes we expect other special weapons to increase in usage and believe that grenade launchers have the potential to become more frustrating to play against as they become even slightly more common so we re planning a small change that specifically touches priming and cleaning up targets scout rifles and hand cannons in pve players have wanted these weapons to be a bit more efficient in pve for some time we ve found that minor enemies in high-end content take too many shots to kill with these weapons machine guns in pve through playtesting and player feedback we ve found they're not doing their intended job well enough so we're planning a noticeable change for season special ammo economy particularly in pvp while the above changes to shotguns should help tone down aggressive frames a bit we've got a couple of small changes planned that should reduce the amount of special ammo floating around to a degree and have further changes in mind in case they re needed anarchy has done too much too well for too many years without even counting the boost it's gotten this season which is due to the sweet grenade launcher artifact mods so we're making changes that make it great at a couple roles rather than being the jack of all grenade launchers exotic primaries we want to give players more reasons to use exotic primary weapons in high-end pve content and have changes coming to help with this and the more distant future we'll keep a close eye on special weapons and will make adjustments once we see how they perform in the wild particularly fusion rifles and grenade launchers we have an idea of what may need more adjustments as these changes shake out but will wait to discuss them as our plans solidify we also keep a close eye on feedback on exotic weapons and which weapons are under overperforming we have some tweaks planned next week in season and beyond which should shake things up note that we specifically look at catalysts as a way to buff underused exotics for example this is why we made catalysts for trinity ghoul and deathbringer so expect similar reasoning moving forward at the risk of being vague we also have long-term plans to address the issues of exotic orb generation and kill trackers without making a catalyst for every exotic in the game and there you have it as chris mentioned this is a bit of a meaty mid-season update while the patch note list isn't the longest you've seen the impact of these changes is expected to be higher than the usual mid-season patch don t expect changes of this scale in the middle of every season but the team worked hard to get these together and out the door trying some of these changes out in playtests has been fun and we re expecting a bit of a shakeup to the meta at least in terms of shotgun usage some shotguns will still be fairly lethal but will require closer range for those sweet one-hit eliminations as always we ll be watching your feedback as these changes go live and planning changes as necessary another patch note preview alongside the sandbox update we have a slew of bug fixes going out with destiny update here s a quick list of some high-priority changes to expect next tuesday when the patch hits your hard

       " Document(page_content=\"this week at bungie we warm up spring is here and competition is in the air the second annual guardian games are kicking off on april the theme of the event returns pitting the classes against each other in a friendly competition to showcase their skills in combat last year titans dominated the field for nearly the entire event can warlocks or hunters bounce back and dethrone those gargantuan punching machines time will tell if you are new to guardian games or need a quick refresher this article is a great place to start in today's twab we'll get into some of the changes for this year s event but before we do let's check out the hype reel last year we received a lot of feedback on how the overall scoring worked you can read through this post for a refresher but the tl dr is we had class-specific score weighting to account for the difference in class population we did this to make sure that hunters didn t have a huge advantage because of well how many hunters there are this year we won t be doing any initial weighting on the scoring everyone s points will count the same at the start how the scoring will work this year medals have the following values bronze point silver points gold points platinum points we still have to account for different class population so this year the class that comes in third place each day gets a permanent bonus on scoring going forward we ve tested this new scoring system using last year s data and a few other data sets and it seems to provide a more competitive guardian games where we see different classes winning throughout the event hunters will likely win early on because of their population advantage but as the bonuses kick in the competition should tighten up quickly new guardian games playlist another new addition to this year s event is the guardian games strikes playlist this is like the standard vanguard strikes playlist but will group players together by class this feeds into the laurel collecting mechanic where players have a chance at bonus laurels when they pick up a laurel generated by a player of the same class modifiers this new playlist will have gameplay modifiers added based on the previous day s class standing classes will get a beneficial modifier tied to gold silver and bronze placement gold health shields and recovery are increased kinetic weapons deal more damage silver melee abilities recharge faster elemental damage increased from guardian sources more heavy ammo available bronze grenade abilities deal more damage and recharge much faster elemental damage increased from guardian sources there are also negative modifiers added to the playlist to make things a little more challenging for the leaders the gold class gets two modifiers and the silver class gets one these modifiers are themed around the classes that finished lower on the podium bronzesilvertitancombatant melee attacks deal more damage combatant melee attacks deal significantly more damage warlockincoming damage increased while airborne incoming damage significantly increased while airborne hunterradar is disabled radar is disabled and combatants don't flinch when damaged silver classes only get the modifier from the bronze class below them gold classes get a combination of both silver and bronze thematically we re going for an experience where the guardian games strike playlist is the venue for players hoping to jockey their classes podium placement as it will likely be one of the most efficient ways to earn laurels medal case you will receive a medal case from eva to store your hardware until you are ready to visit the podium in the tower to bank them for your team once you have the maximum medals for a certain type in your case make sure you go turn them as any more earned for that type will be lost turning in medals will give you a chance at receiving an event package depending on the medal type contender card this year we are introducing a new way to earn points for your team called contender cards you will be able to pick these up from eva in exchange for laurels and can have one active at any given time completing objectives in strikes crucible and gambit will grant a gold medal upon completion there is also a special platinum contender card that will focus on completing objectives in nightfalls survival and trials this will be the only way to earn platinum medals completing a platinum card will earn you all-star status and a special reward at the next podium ceremony make sure you complete your platinum contender card before daily reset on friday if you want to lock in your all-star status for the weekend podium ceremonyevery weekend there will be a special ceremony where you will be able show off a glow from your class item depending on your class standing that week third place receives a bronze glow second place receives a silver glow first place receives a gold glow all-stars receive a platinum glow we will be throwing a special final weekend closing ceremony in the tower that will be live from may to may to celebrate the winning class rewards as with any event there will be new loot to grab at the start of the event you will get is a new class item from zavala these are required to participate in the games your old class items won't work for this event even though they still look cool super cool there will be a new exotic sparrow you can earn during the event because every guardian can use a new set of wheels ok maybe not wheels since they hover but you get the point it s a cool vehicle that you can drive fly drift yeah you can definitely drift them anyway there will also be new emblems and shaders to collect and heir apparent is back for anyone who didn t get it last year proud owners of the tanky exotic machine gun now have a new catalyst to earn if you want to roleplay as valus ta'arc this catalyst will provide even beefier shields for you as you cabal-stomp your way through the battlefield there will also be new eververse collectibles including but not limited to a new universal ornament armor set at beyond light's release we said we would be working to make future universal ornament sets more accepting of shaders new tech allows us to achieve this change more easily and the gg sets are a great example here is a peek at some of the offerings bungie rewards your chance for glory and rewards begins next week but guardians can get a preview of the bungie rewards starting now players who earn the guardian games exotic sparrow can

that saladin offers iron banner start april at am pst end april at am pst before we go we d like to take a moment to look forward in time season of redacted is coming in a few short weeks and saladin has a few new items up his sleeve for you to earn when the new season begins in may a familiar hand cannon and sniper rifle will be rejoining the fight but two new weapons are also making their debut our goals moving forward are to continue bringing some year- weapons up to speed with random rolls but also bringing some new rewards into the fold when possible this always depends a bit on what resources we have for a given season but we re looking forward to a few new iron banner-themed tools for your arsenal looking even further out we re planning new armor for iron banner these sets won t appear for a few seasons but we have heard your desire for some new digs once we have more information we ll let you know until then we hope you enjoy the new weapons the never-ending search for balance prepping for season of redacted we have a few changes that will be coming to the destiny sandbox this week we ll be focusing on things that are hot so to speak weapons and archetypes that need to be tuned in order to create breathing room for other aspects of the destiny sandbox to shine we re also planning quite a few buffs to underused perks linear fusion rifles and more the current plan is to cover perk and weapon buffs in an upcoming twab towards the end of april once they re solidified but we wanted to get this information out earlier than normal to keep you all informed without further ado weapons feature lead chris proctor is here once again to lay out our goals with these upcoming changes and give you the nitty-gritty details weapon archetypes aggressive rpm hand cannons are very dominant in pvp and we've received enough feedback that we want to rein them in a bit without completely taking away their range benefits these weapons will now have damage and aim assist falloff distance reduced by between and meters based on the range stat this roughly halves the range buff they received in beyond light vortex frame swords -- with falling guillotine now viable forever we need to adjust it a little as its damage output is flat out higher than all other legendary swords with this change we allow it to keep its high damage output but are reducing its full-reserves damage output by reducing the number of heavy attacks you'll be able to perform full energy heavy attack ammo cost increased from to chip damage -- certain weapons swords and bastion bypass shields by varying amounts which has caused numerous issues with stasis-encased enemies encounter mechanics and other content we have removed chip damage from swords and bastion perks quickdraw -- this perk is intended to provide faster swap speed but it also passively buffs handling by this completely negates the downside of using low-handling weapons such as aggressive shotguns sniper rifles and hand cannons which isn't something we want to encourage those weapons should have downsides and working around those completely via a perk isn't healthy we don't think allowing a fast-swap to the shotgun subfamily with the highest one-hit-kill range is great either the handling bonus is now removed one second after switching to this weapon or upon aiming down sights replaced quickdraw with surplus on new and existing drops of felwinter s lie and astral horizon frenzy -- this perk has extremely high uptime in pve to the point where it is clearly a better choice than most other damage perks we like the high uptime and want to preserve that but want it to award less damage than harder to activate damage perks reduced bonus damage from percent to percent reservoir burst -- now increases magazine size in addition to its other effects reduced full battery bonus damage from percent to percent upcoming content requires revisiting the power level of a damage perk that can be activated simply by having a full magazine wink wink nudge nudge say no more exotics the lament -- this weapon is a clear outlier for sword damage so for the health of heavy weapon diversity we're pulling it back a bit reduced damage of revved heavy attack by approximately percent note that the lament retains standard anti-barrier despite removing chip damage bastion -- since we're removing chip damage bastion gets something else instead we ve noticed increased feedback on bastion and higher than normal usage in pvp so are making a small change here and will revisit bastion later intrinsically staggers unstoppable champions increased spread angle by percent with all balance changes we will continue to watch how they play once they're in the wild and will look to make further adjustments based on our observations and player feedback suit up sometimes the only thing standing between guardians and a successful outing is a single armor piece this week a new seasonal challenge required some very specific gear for completion and our player support team has the details on why some of you may have been missing out on progress this is their report suited for combat seasonal challenge this week we introduced the ninth week of season of the chosen seasonal challenges one of the challenges suited for combat asked players to defeat targets anywhere in the system wearing a full set of armor but it didn t clarify that the armor had to be the praefectus seasonal armor only the praefectus season of the chosen armor will grant progress toward this challenge inactivity in grandmaster nightfalls since the grandmaster nightfall was introduced we noticed that some players who can t be revived will eventually get kicked out of the activity due to inactivity to mitigate this issue in future grandmaster nightfalls players should open their character or director screens and go through their menus to avoid being removed from activity we are investigating a solution for this issue in a future season dismantle your shaders beginning in season launching may we are overhauling our shader system and how shaders can be applied to armor due to the overhaul shaders will become permanent unlocks and all shaders in player inventories will be removed we encourage everyone to dismantle their shaders before season begins to receive glimmer and legendary shards more

       " Document(page_content=\"this week at bungie we have modifications on our mind guardians are further proving their worth as proving grounds has become the featured nightfall strike we ve also added it to the vanguard strike playlist so all players will now have a chance to tackle the giant tank on nessus so if you haven t had a chance to log in this week it s a great time to load up the game if you ve been playing you re probably waiting for me to tell you something you don t already know so let s get to it gear up with the return of ada- to the tower in season we are introducing some small quality of life upgrades to a couple of our tower vendors first in addition to being the primary vendor associated with the upcoming transmog system also known as armor synthesis ada- will become the vendor who delivers a variety of armor-focused items and upgrades each day ada- will now sell one randomly chosen armor mod from the general and armor slot helmet gauntlets etc groups and one randomly chosen combat style armor mod chosen from the charged with light and warmind cell mod groups which should make it easier for players who missed these in the past to get their hands on some of the armor mods from year additionally on a weekly basis ada- will sell one armor set randomly chosen from the world loot pool with a stat roll that also changes on a weekly basis finally ada- will also sell armor upgrade materials upgrade modules enhancement prisms and ascendant shards in the same way that the banshee- does right now with ada- taking on armor responsibilities banshee- is getting a few revisions to his inventory as well the gunsmith will no longer sell armor mods but will retain the rest of the items that he currently sells additionally on a weekly basis banshee- will sell a selection of six weapons randomly chosen from the weapons in the world loot pool two weapons each from the kinetic energy and power slots with perk rolls on each weapon that are randomly determined at the start of the week so at each weekly reset when you log in you can head to the tower and see what the gunsmith is selling and maybe pick up a weapon you ve been looking for with a roll you are excited to use last one standing we have received some feedback on perks like celerity and bottomless grief from players asking that they be added as intrinsic bonuses to adept weapons weapons feature lead chris proctor is here to share some of our philosophy on these perks and a few changes we are planning chris proctor when we launched trials of osiris we made a new origin-specific perk for trials weapons celerity this is a wildly powerful perk aim assist handling and reload plus reduced recoil and spread this perk is nothing to sneeze at with very low uptime we intended this to be great for clutch last guardian standing plays in trials specifically and when it's active it is very strong but we found that a trigger condition that relies on failure generally feels pretty bad and the power it grants doesn't negate that feeling players never like betting against themselves or their teams not only that but the perk is useless outside of trials and a couple of other activities sidenote the deep stone crypt origin perks were well-received so while celerity specifically didn't hit the mark the idea still has legs in beyond light we introduced adept weapons to trials wanting to try out a new system for aspirational weapons in a small set before rolling them out more broadly we had three goals for adept weapons give players a tangible reward to aspire towards with custom visuals and a unique name letting them flex a little give players who've earned an adept weapon a minor power boost and some gameplay customization options in the form of the improved masterwork granting to all other stats and the ability to equip adept mods do not make players who can't earn these weapons feel like they can't compete with players who have them cough not forgotten cough we've seen all of your suggestions to make celerity and bottomless grief intrinsic to trials and nightfall weapons or only to the adept versions and i wanted to touch on this idea thematically this is a cool idea and adds to the flavor that these perks can give their sources but there are three problems for performance reasons we have a maximum number of perks that can run on a character at a time legendary weapons have a threshold per weapon and many of them are right at the limit - adding a perk on top of that without taking one away causes bad things to happen in the form of random parts of perks turning off adding a new perk column to weapons from a specific source introduces power creep and pretty soon we'd end up having to do the same to weapons from other sources adding a new perk column to only adept weapons would work against the third goal of adept weapons and we believe would feel bad for players dying to adept weapons that are able to stack celerity with things like outlaw and rampage in season we're making the following changes to trials and nightfall weapons and their adept versions note this only applies to new drops of these weapons not previous drops nightfall weapons bottomless grief grants a permanently active to magazine bottomless grief is now a fixed alternate perk in the left column on adept drops of nightfall weapons i e you can switch between that and the randomly rolled perk in the inspection screen trials weapons celerity grants a permanently active to both reload and handling celerity is now a fixed alternate perk in the right column on adept drops of trials weapons i e you can switch between that and the randomly rolled perk in the inspection screen moving forward we're not done with origin perks and hope to have something that better achieves our goals in a future release spooky scary stream team next week we are going to be firing up the stream machine again we had a lot of fun last month when we featured a

functions in crucible combat if you haven t read up on the patch notes from tuesday s hotfix check them out now this week we ll be looking at some lobby balancing changes being tested in iron banner and covering a fresh set of prime gaming rewards read on for more lobby balancing act in june of we made some changes to remove skill based matchmaking from all playlists except survival since the change we ve been monitoring player feedback watching data and getting some hands on in the crucible to see how games felt with connection based matchmaking prioritized a common feedback item has concerned lobby balancing and how we distribute players among fireteams within a crucible match starting today we'll be testing out some changes to how players are split between teams once a match has been formed in iron banner and iron banner freelance playlists these changes are expected to be deployed around am pacific so by the time you re reading this twab they may already be in place to give a simple explanation of the change our current algorithm tries to make the average skill level even between the teams which can lead to lopsided teams depending on the skill range of everyone put in the match with the changes being deployed today we re updating our crucible lobby balancer to balance teams with a modified algorithm which can be compared to school yard pick or snake draft this will attempt to place the best player on team one second best player on team two third best player on team two fourth best player on team one and so on as a note we are making no changes to matchmaking this is specifically a change to how players are divided among teams once a match has been formed we ll be watching feedback over the weekend to see how players are feeling about this change in iron

       " Document(page_content=\"this week at bungie we re back in action it s been a while hasn t it since the last twab you ve gotten your hands on hawkmoon the dawning has come and gone next-generation consoles received some wonderful enhancements you ve released a crow from their cage and lord saladin watched as you decimated your foes with stasis in the iron banner on the bungie side of things we took a breather this last year has been full of challenges that none of us expected even through everything had in store we were able to get beyond light and season of the hunt in your hands this did come at a bit of a cost though and we needed some time to recharge our batteries for a new year we have no doubt that will have mountains to climb and unexpected surprises but we re all excited to get back into the groove for a new year of destiny development so let s get this party started we ve got four twabs between you and a fresh season of destiny content you re hungry for what we've got planned and we re eager to dish out the goods first up we ll be looking at a few changes to vendors dreaming city and moon rewards and some sandbox tuning for hunter stasis abilities in the crucible rewards update dreaming city and the moon since the launch of beyond light we ve been collecting what feels like a metric ton of feedback on various destiny systems while we ve shared some plans related to rewards ddos protection on consoles crossplay and transmog we have new details on rewards from two of our more recent destinations the moon and the dreaming city rewards area lead justin dazet will be walking us through some changes in response to player feedback justin last month assistant game director joe blackburn spoke about some changes we were making to gear in season in response to some feedback today we re going to briefly chat about what some of these changes are as they relate to our back catalog of expansions and the reasoning behind them first let s review a list of what you ll see starting in season reissued dreaming city reverie dawn and moon dreambane armor these will also drop with high stats when earned in shattered throne or pit of heresy the final chest in pit of heresy will no longer drop a fully masterworked dreambane armor piece instead the dreambane armor piece that drops will have armor energy and is guaranteed to drop with at least a in two different stats and higher stats overall dreambane class items will not drop from this chest reissued weapons for dreaming city with new perk pools waking vigil sleepless vouchsafe and retold tale dreaming city weapons that drop in the shattered throne dungeon can roll with perks that are unavailable from drops from other reward sources reissued weapons for the moon with new perk pools premonition pit of heresy only heretic blasphemer and apostate weapons that drop in the pit of heresy dungeon can roll with perks that are unavailable from drops from other reward sources expanding lost sector legend and master rotation to moon sectors k logistics k communication k crew quarters and k revelation we are making these changes to help preserve the relevancy of the destinations specifically some of the pinnacle end-game activities that still exist there to get more specific around the actual experience activities where re-issues are acquired will be heavily weighted towards rewarding re-issued gear over capped gear -- though the exact weighting and mechanisms may differ for example in the dreaming city if you have already obtained an infusion capped weapon it will not drop for you again while not every gear source or legendary reward will be kept up to date for the entire lifetime these destinations are available we do believe there s high value in targeting some specific activity drops for continued relevancy to give you more options for where to spend time as you seek to improve your arsenal turn in those tokens since destiny launched guardians have been amassing vendor reputation tokens these could be turned in for legendary gear which would usually be dismantled for legendary shards and materials looking to the future the team is excited to update the ways in which you earn reputation with ritual vendors and the rewards that come from them dazet back to you justin the rewards for continuous ritual playlist completion has been a subject that s come up several times as we ve looked over beyond light feedback and we re happy to announce some changes coming soon to gambit crucible and strike reward structure firstly we ll be adding two new unique weapon rewards to each of the three playlist rituals so six total across all three activities these weapons are in addition to the ones added in season of the hunt and continue to have a small chance to drop at the end of each activity second starting in season for gambit and crucible valor and in a future season for strikes rank rewards will be visible on the ritual vendors each season you ll be greeted by a row of rewards progression toward which will be earned automatically as you complete relevant playlist activities instead of having rank rewards dropped automatically into your loot stream they now will be picked up manually from the vendor lists we feel this gives much better visibility into what you ll be earning as you progress and helps you make better choices about where to spend your time progression is on a per-ritual basis you can be on rank for crucible and rank for gambit for example you ll reset your rank right at the vendor by picking up the final reward rewards for each individual ritual are as follows rank x upgrade modules rank x enhancement cores rank seasonal ritual shader changes to x enhancement cores after resetting your rank rank x enhancement prisms rank seasonal ritual emblem changes to x enhancement prisms after resetting your rank reset reward ascendant shard changes to exotic engram after resetting your rank every rank-up awards a base ritual engram just like before additionally each of the above ranks also awards a prime ritual engram due to this automated progression crucible tokens and crucible token gifts are no longer needed and will be deprecated into junk that will delete as a full stack starting in season so cash those tokens in before the end of the season and get ready to earn some masterwork materials taking a pass revenant shatterdive fissures the conversation and feedback on rewards wasn t the only thing we were tracking over the holiday break many of you have been spending time in the crucible experimenting with stasis and all of the ways in which it can change the flow of a pvp match prior to the break we had a round of tuning for warlocks next up we re looking at hunters but also have some comments on our approach to future stasis tuning as we head in to the new year please welcome combat area lead tomonori kinoshita back to the twab to talk through our goals for stasis abilities in pvp tomo over the holiday break we saw trials go live and with that a wealth of valuable feedback from the community along with this feedback we have been tracking data from trials and identified some short-term changes as well as more mid-term goals we are focusing on in the coming weeks and months short term goal address outlier stasis abilities to keep subclass decision making interesting reduce the potency of shatter dive whisper of fissures against guardians going live with update shatterdive now has damage falloff vs unfrozen targets max range damage reduced from to damage reduction during ability reduced from to whisper of fissures reduced max-min damage vs non-super players from - to - reduced max-min damage vs super players from - to - reduced detonation radius vs players from m to m investigate the efficacy of the stasis titan behemoth super we want to let the above change settle to see where the behemoth stands in our pvp hierarchy but this is next on our radar mid-term goal improve pvp subclass usage and win-rate balance addressing stasis ability outliers will help us lower the ceiling but we also want to pull up other underperforming light subclasses mid-term goal review our ability-to-gunplay balance in pvp destiny is a game about both explosive space magic moments and intrinsically satisfying gunplay especially in our v playlists the usage of abilities has climbed as we introduce more and more ways to charge them quickly we re still in very early discussions but we re looking into restoring a better balance where proper gunplay is rewarding in these playlists a few of you noticed that prior to our holiday break we were able to get a few sandbox changes delivered faster than expected thanks to changes on destiny s backend and the destiny content vault our patch pipeline is indeed better than before that said some changes won't happen at light speed as our team wants the appropriate time to collect feedback check the data and test proposed changes once these changes have been validated we ll be eager to get you details via twabs blog articles and more worldwide community sometimes it can be difficult to think of how large the destiny community has become since it seems no matter where you may be in the world you might bump in to a fellow hunter warlock or titan last year we bolstered our efforts with the addition of two international community managers join us in welcoming a third to the team introducing our new russian community manager ivan yanyushkin ivan privet my name is ivan and

experience will help me but i will also be thankful for your guidance feel free to reach out to tell me what works what doesn t and how things can be improved for the destiny community one day when

finisher which will be available for silver here is a preview of a few of the sparrows ghost shells and a ship that are sure to get you in the spirit super smash warlock melee shortly after launch we put out a hotfix to reel in stasis a bit when we made these changes we wanted them to have as much efficacy as possible and that meant using broad strokes to cover a lot of ground this led to us hitting penumbral blast's range harder than many players felt was necessary upon review and hearing the feedback we felt that while penumbral blast's range needed to come in - there is room to push it back out and have it feel more consistent when hitting targets at range here is a preview of patch notes coming in a hotfix next week penumbral blast projectile range increased by minimum distance to cast ranged melee reduced by this allows you to throw the ranged melee closer to targets one million dollars you have been absolutely crushing it raising money to support the bungie foundation and

since update on december we ve been investigating various connection issues including the following error codes prune and weasel the bee cacao centipede and chicken error codes have since been resolved trials of osiris reward schedule trials of osiris is expected to return on december due to the delay of launching trials a few changes were made to the reward schedule during the first four weeks the flawless chest will drop an adept weapon the fifth week will drop an armor piece with subsequent weeks switching the rewards back and forth between adept weapons and armor as previously mentioned here adept weapon mods will drop each week ps friends list update since the launch of beyond light we ve been investigating an issue for playstation players who could only see a small number of their friends online in their roster we discovered this issue only affected those with more than friends in their roster this issue has been resolved but after further testing we discovered another issue affecting how online friends are displayed that issue will be fixed on december in hotfix xbox series x s freezing issuewhile unlikely it s possible that destiny may freeze up when signing out of an xbox live profile while inside the game we recommend quitting out of the destiny app first before signing out if the game does freeze players can press the xbox guide button on their controller select destiny and then select quit this issue will be fixed on december in hotfix vesper of radius updatelast friday we disabled vesper of radius due to it being possible to cast a rift while falling off a ledge which when combined with stasis could result in a quick lethal combo to opposing players in crucible rift energy wasn t being used so it was possible to repeat again right after execution this issue will be fixed on december in hotfix spoils of conquest we re investigating an issue where players can put their spoils of conquest raid currency in their vault resulting in it disappearing while we continue our investigation players should refrain from putting spoils of conquest in their vault next-gen updates xbox series x s and playstation players who are migrating from xbox one and

       " Document(page_content=\"hey everybody my name is joe blackburn and i m the assistant game director on destiny if your free time looks anything like mine you ve been spending a lot of it on europa over the past few weeks some of you may know me from my previous bungie life when i worked with the raid team and on season of opulence i'm back thanks to a revive from luke and team as we work together to create a destiny future that we re all excited about today i want to spend some time with you on a subject that is near and dear to every destiny player s heart rewards there s a thing i ask a lot around the virtual office how are we making every season the best time to jump back into destiny destiny is a very large and complex game and while this is what also makes it a game we love we want destiny to continue to evolve to be a world with momentum introducing infusion caps is part of addressing this a way to make sure that the overall number of rewards guardians need to care about in order to be competitive in destiny isn t prohibitive it is also a way to continue evolving each season s meta while at the same time making sure players still have a ton of options when choosing what they want to bring into the next challenge our goal from the beginning with infusion caps is to improve and keep destiny fresh over time - what we re most looking forward to is how this system will introduce innovation to the season-over-season meta how creative builds from the community will shine and how we can continue to deliver more unique hand-crafted gear that aligns with the world narrative and where the universe is going while we still are hard at work on improvements to how we rotate gear out of the destiny power ecosystem what gear you can infuse to max power there were a few clear-cut misses with our first rollout the initial reward pool with this release was just too small it's frustrating to be playing destiny and see another player use a weapon that is no longer obtainable in game i m going to spend a lot of time talking rewards but before we deep dive let's get the tl dr out there these are the big commitments we re making today with each season in year destiny will grow the overall power ecosystem for weapons with very few exceptions all weapons you can take to the power cap should still be earnable in game future annual releases will contain more new weapons to collect than beyond light or shadowkeep growing the power ecosystemwith beyond light we took on the huge challenge of rebuilding our technology from the ground up one of the benefits of this was improving the speeds with which we could make and update destiny you ve already seen some of those gains since launch with updates such as buffing the legendary engram coming in much faster than we ve been able to do in the past but season will be here in just a couple of months very soon in the world of destiny development so let's talk about how we are continuing to leverage our technology to act with agility season is the first chance for us to prove our commitment to growing the overall power ecosystem with each release in year we want to make sure that with each new season there are more weapons to take with you to tackle that nightfall ordeal or master bunker e than there were before while i won t be spoiling what new stuff you ll be able to chase in our next season i did want to touch on a few changes we ve made to the reward offering specifically based on what we ve seen in beyond light in season we re adding six new legendary weapons to our ritual activities two each for strikes gambit and crucible in addition to the weapons above nightfall strikes are getting three unique weapons with the palindrome the swarm and shadow price all making their destiny debuts if you re brave enough to take on grandmaster nightfalls you will be also able to earn adept versions of these weapons keeping currentseason not only represents the start of our commitment to growing the power ecosystem but it also is an opportunity for us to improve how we can keep destiny accessible to new players new guardians are essential to the health of our community and as with our investment in features like the new light introduction on the cosmodrome we must also invest in making sure the reward structure of destiny is approachable to everyone in a recent patch we added the season and weapons to the world drop pool and we removed the season weapons this was important for a few reasons we want to make sure that players have a way to earn all power-relevant weaponry in the live game if a group of new guardians is just getting into grandmaster nightfalls and they see guides on youtube involving warmind cells we need to provide a path for them to participate at the same time we don t want to be clogging up the reward streams with weapons that are about to exit the power ecosystem so anything that s only going to be around for a few more months shouldn t be something a player can accidentally obtain in season we will continue to allow all players to gain season and season weapons in the world drop pool while season weapons will be obtainable through a more prescriptive source this means that legendary engrams will no longer reward these soon-to-expire weapons if you want to chase a specific piece of soon-to-be-capped loot you ll find it with the gunsmith this is all part of our larger commitment to making sure that players can always earn anything they might need to take on challenging activities that said this will require a few exceptions and some updates to the live game as far as exceptions we don t plan on adding methods for players to acquire holiday weapons like the braytech werewolf outside of participating in those yearly celebrations for updates this does mean in season we will be adding limited time quest weapons like felwinter s lie whisper of the worm and outbreak perfected to the exotic kiosk in the tower quality and quantity after covering things we d like to change i want to spend some time talking about what must stay the same destiny is a game built on exciting rewards from bastion to ikelos smg v to falling guillotine the rewards over the last twelve months have continued to evolve the way guardians play the game in beyond light i believe the rewards team nailed it again with incredible new legendary perks like recombination thresh chain reaction and reconstruction alongside these perks came what i believe is one of the best lineups of exotic weapons and armor in destiny history but where we succeeded in quality we failed in quantity even as season the deep stone crypt and the full breadth of europa weapons came online the total count of weapons in beyond light is lower than we want so we re making the commitment now that our future annual releases will have more weapon rewards than beyond light or shadowkeep there s no way for us to make more rewards at destiny s standards and still maintain the health of our current team therefore we re going to reinforce the rewards team with more talent that will allow us to deliver quality and quantity in the future molding someone new into a master destiny gunsmith takes time this isn t going to be a change that the community will feel next week but it does put our best foot forward as we step towards the witch queen and lightfall preheating the ovenincreasing the reward team s size is one of our long-term initiatives but it is not the only upgrade to our gear rotation plan that we want to get into the oven we envision a better solution for how armor intersects with infusion caps the personality of armor comes from mods right now so gaining a new piece of armor often means just trying to find a piece of armor that replicates the stat allocation you already have on a piece in your vault while we are not ready to talk concretely about armor plans right now we do want to get more gameplay novelty on armor itself so that looting a piece of armor in a new season has the potential to change the way you play expect to hear more about armor and other holistic upgrades to the way gear rotates in and out of the power ecosystem as we harden plans in the new year and that new year will be here before you know it a big chunk of the team will be taking some hard-earned time off to rest and relax ahead of coming back to the studio and diving into we have a lot of work to do and while i m looking forward to the break i also can t wait to get to work on some of the huge stuff we ve got coming in the new year without spoiling too much here s a brief teaser of some of the things that are on their way in destiny year transmog will be coming with season more details to come see work-in-progress screen captures below not final may change ddos protection for destiny players on all consoles will be coming in season the vault of glass raid returns crossplay is coming in two strikes fallen s a b e r and devil s lair are coming to destiny in season legendary and master lost sector rotation will be expanded to include the lost sectors on the moon in season and there will be new three new pieces of exotic armor to chase returning to orbitnow that i ve ranted longer than a raid leader on val ca'uor let s wrap this thing up has been a hard year for so many folks out there and i hope that beyond light has been able to be a bright spot over the past couple of weeks playing destiny alongside you helps keep us going we re going to keep our ears and eyes open for more feedback as we continue towards i hope your holiday treats you well and can t wait to share more destiny with you in the new year thanks for your time joe\", metadata={'Title': 'Destiny 2 Dev Update -

a few other goodies for you to unlock throughout the event when reaching certain donation milestones stay tuned for the full game give article planned for december tuning the darkness it s not often that an entirely new subclass makes its entrance into the ecosystem of destiny the team has been hard at work over the last year building abilities and supers powered by the darkness enemies around the solar system are shaking in fear of your stasis powers including your fellow guardians in the crucible depending on when this article goes live a hotfix may or may not be in the wild we have some notes from the development team on what s changing in destiny hotfix development team we have seen a lot of feedback on stasis since beyond light launched last week we ve heard it s a ton of fun to use but certain aspects of this new subclass can be frustrating to go up against looking at you shadebinder warlocks we have a few minor tweaks planned to go out in hotfix this week our goal here is to do some early tuning to rein shadebinders back in while still maintaining their overall efficacy and power fantasy stasis changes stasis breakout damage reduced - hp adjusted the curve that reduces breakout damage using resilience increased the damage reduction effect resilience has so that higher tiers of resilience are more valuable caps out at resilience penumbral blast stasis warlock melee projectile speed reduced by penumbral blast stasis warlock melee range reduced was m now m winter wrath stasis warlock super duration reduced s - s winters wrath light attack stasis warlock super cost reduced per burst - per burst cold snap seeker speed reduced by against guardians cold snap freeze duration lowered s - s ice flare bolts freeze duration lowered s - s penumbral blast stasis warlock melee freeze duration lowered s - s winters wrath heavy attack stasis warlock super no longer affects players who are not encased with all that said we believe strongly in the cosmic ice wizard fantasy in pve so we re trying to target changes where we can towards the pvp experience specifically with stasis we ve tried to push the sandbox in new directions and that increases the likelihood we introduce something spicier than normal when it comes to crafting new abilities we believe the risk of shipping something a little hot is better than playing it safe and shipping something that doesn t get you excited as always we re going to be using data playtesting and feedback to help refine our direction and we re going to keep responding this will not be the last change to stasis this season as we get closer to future changes we ll make another appearance in the twab for a patch note preview thanks for playing and we ll see you out there in the wild let s talk loot since beyond light launched we ve been working through a whirlwind of feedback what feels good what needs work and most importantly how are you feeling today we ll be talking through a bit of player feedback concerning loot and some short term plans the development team is working on development team as beyond light has launched we've been tracking your feedback around loot particularly weapons and wanted to take a moment to let you know how we are processing it today we're going to talk mostly about the short-term with more information to follow in the future around the long-term as we work through those problems infusion caps are intended to help keep destiny evolving and ensure that every release the new rewards are exciting and relevant to the meta however we agree with your feedback that there s currently not enough variety in the world loot weapons available to players this season to that end we are adding back in a selection of weapons that will help alleviate this issue we will also be watching to see how the landscape changes with the addition of weapons from season and this week s raid launch we also agree that getting near-cap weapons from random world drops is frustrating thus we are removing those from the pool and are weighting drops more heavily towards newer weapons here s a list of adjustments to the world loot legendary weapons pool you ll see with our november hotfix remove all legendary weapons that hit their infusion cap at the end of this season add all of the seventh seraph weapons from season add all of the season seasonal and planetary reprisal weapons weight drop chances so the newer an item is the more likely it is to drop while we are not yet ready to dive into the long-term strategy yet we are listening to feedback and watching how the player build landscape evolves over these first few weeks of beyond light and incorporating that feedback as we plan out future seasons feedback never stops and we re always excited to hear how you re feeling about destiny keep it coming bashing some bugs this last week has been a whirlwind new content new bugs and new investigations destiny player support has a full report of what s we ve found and what we re still on the hunt for this is their report hotfix today november maintenance for hotfix will begin below is a timeline of events november am pst utc destiny maintenance for hotfix

duration of the effect bosses will automatically shatter out after some duration against players freeze will lock players into place when applied for the duration of the effect while frozen players will have their class ability replaced with a new breakout ability that allows players to exit their freeze early at the trade-off of health the damage this breakout does can be reduced by the resilience stat the more resilience the less damage you take players can activate their supers to immediately breakout in super state against players in roaming supers locks players in place until broken out players will quickly shatter out and take a small amount of damage against one-off supers suppresses super and locks players in place until broken out or expires all player freeze rules

       " Document(page_content=\"this week at bungie there is just a lot going on right now what a week it started out with a brand new vidoc showcasing bungie developers giving you a behind-the-scenes look at what we ve been cooking up from home now we ll pause the twab for minutes so you can go watch it in all its glory even if you already watched it go watch it again don t worry we ll wait on you that was your first look into season of the hunt as well as a deeper dive into beyond light stasis new light and our plans for year we also mentioned that most seasonal content is going to be sticking around throughout the year and showed off a new calendar for beyond light and season of the hunt start writing these dates in your calendars or i guess like - programming them into your virtual calendars you do you we followed that up by pushing out the beyond light launch trailer this morning featuring some good vibes and a familiar soundtrack it s one of the last action-packed previews of beyond light you ll get before it launches in less than a fortnight we'll pause the twab one more time so you can watch it but this is it no more pauses after this that s all we got for you this week nah just kidding we got a lot more to cover let s get to it progression changes the start of any new destiny expansion begins with a power climb as you experience the campaign and play through the story missions after finishing that up and completing some additional quests and activities you re usually around what we call the soft cap and will need to start earning powerful rewards to continue to increase power so you can tackle some of the more aspirational activities in the endgame after you reach the hard cap then there is an additional power you can earn through earning pinnacle rewards if you choose to hit the pinnacle cap here are the new power caps you are aiming for when the next season begins on november soft cap hard cap pinnacle cap when you first log in next season all of your weapons and armor will be at power or higher if you have anything already over it will be unchanged and anything under will be brought up to all new players will start at as well powerful reward changes we ve heard a lot of feedback from players for more opportunities to earn powerful rewards from the activities you enjoy most we have a change coming that will allow you to have a chance to earn powerful rewards from strikes gambit crucible and from seasonal drops all the way up until the hard cap it will still be much quicker to continue to complete all the powerful reward sources each week but if you just want to play strikes or crucible matches all day every day you can continue to earn powerful rewards we hope this helps you to continue increasing your power during the period when you are still close to the soft cap and may find completing some of the powerful sources like the ordeal very difficult tokens and collectionsdestiny is at its best when you are shooting aliens getting loot and becoming more powerful that gameplay loop breaks down when the best way to increase your power can be standing in the tower handing tokens to lord shaxx starting next season gear received from collections and turning in tokens will have a lower power than in previous seasons gear earned through token purchases will be power below your power level and collection buybacks will be capped at power economy changes some currencies and items have changes coming either at the end of this seasons or in the near future here is what to expect when you login next season materials with no home with several destinations going into the destiny content vault many of you have been wondering what is going to happen to the currencies found in the areas currently underneath the pyramids the simple answer is that there are no changes to these currencies in season of the hunt and you will be able to continue to spend them at vendors normally starting in season phaseglass needles alkane dust simulation seeds and seraphite will be no longer accepted by vendors for those of you that still have unspent stockpiles at the end of season of the hunt spider will be kind enough to offer a small glimmer exchange to take them off your hands but you ll realize the best value by spending them before that point so make sure you turn in your stockpiles before the end of next season there are other items that will be removed from your inventory at the end of season of arrivals some like faction tokens have not had a purpose in quite a while and others like expired ramen coupons never really had a purpose but held some sentimental value we know that it might hard to part with those but it s time to let them go check out this help article for the full list of items that will no longer be in your inventory at the start of season of the hunt bountiesback in late april we shared some plans on how to tackle the problem of bounty fatigue we have made some shifts to seasonal bounties and reduced their importance on earning seasonal currency and seasonal progress we re happy with these changes but still want to continue to improve the bounty system overall one of the plans we previewed was to eventually replace weekly bounties with a new mechanism to provide players with a set of non-expiring and account-scoped objectives each week that will grant lots of season rank progress we re still working on that system and will share more on it before its targeted release of season season passthe season pass you've come to know since shadowkeep is largely staying the same there will be new weapons and armor to earn off both the free track and the owned path one big change we are making is adding bright dust to the season pass as mentioned before we wanted to change the way you earn bright dust and move more towards account-specific paths to give players with only one character significantly more bright dust than they've been earning over the last year here is the high-level look at the changes coming next season season pass free path will now offer bright dust season pass owned path will now offer bright dust weekly bounties will now award bright dust with these changes the vast majority of players will be earning more bright dust than before one of our goals here is to not have a system that pushes you to try to grind out every weekly bounty on all three characters every single week whether you are a three-character player or only play a hunter bright dust will be more available when earning ranks on the season pass we will also be making a change to the timing of season pass rank purchases which will be available starting in week five instead of week nine we have more plans for improving how you earn bright dust coming in season and will continue to monitor your feedback i ve been talking a lot let s change it up here is design lead justin dazet to tell you about some changes spider is making to his wares and to answer a question we have been seeing about the customization updates we are making to your ghosts spider s dealings justin dazet spider is going through some changes in beyond light though a notoriously savvy black-market dealer our favorite four-armed friend has been largely the same for quite some time now but the impending journey to europa has finally given him a reason to tune up the materials exchange and make two key changes first spider will no longer be selling legendary shards this exchange was removed mainly because it was not seeing enough use particularly when compared with the other exchange offers after reviewing player balances and the frequency with which this exchange was accessed it was an easy decision to free up the space for something much more interesting in place of the legendary shard exchange spider is now selling enhancement prisms these highly valued items come at a cost legendary shards per prism and he s stingy with them so you can only purchase three a week but we wanted to give those of you with higher balances a way to transmute your legendary shards into something a little more valuable than planetary materials and upgrade modules second we ve taken another look at how the enhancement core exchange works and made some changes the ascending cost mechanism has been removed and in its place spider will now sell you five enhancement cores a day for fixed price of legendary shards each while this does limit the number of cores you can acquire from him each day we feel a consistent price is a clearer experience with less chance to accidentally spend large quantities of legendary shards more importantly it s also cheaper in the old purchase model you d pay legendary shards for five enhancement cores and then in the new model you ll only pay shards each which equals out to legendary shards for five enhancement cores so while it does limit your acquisition rate it actually will save you legendary shards every five cores got to go fast finally we ve seen a few people wondering if you ll be able to equip the ghost mod speed demon with other mods like guiding light in the new system and we have some good news for you you won t need to starting in beyond light all sparrows both legendary and exotic will innately summon instantly even without the transmat preloader perk as a result there is no need for a ghost mod to impact this functionality so speed demon was not carried forward into the new system if you re already driving around a sparrow with transmat preloader you can keep using it and it will work just fine or you can pull it from collections again and get two new perks newly created sparrows will no longer roll on transmat preloader so you have a chance to get yourself an extra perk and still retain that instant summon speed hop on that newly instant-summoning sparrow and zip on over to check out spider s new offers he s ready and waiting to wrap those four greedy arms around some of your wealth and make you a deal you can t refuse eververse starting in season of the hunt bright engrams will now contain all eververse content from season to three seasons prior to the current season excluding

       " Document(page_content=\"this week at bungie we ve got a sweet tooth for loot boo did i scare you probably not but hey it s festival of the lost things are feeling a bit spookier than usual i can t take a turn in the tower without running into a guardian dressed for the occasion eva levante has returned masks and all if you missed the rundown on our spooky seasonal event last week be sure to read last week s blog article tuesday kicked off the festival of the lost but we ve also unveiled a few treats that will be coming your way in november beyond light is opening the doors to europa and renewing your quest for sweet precious loot in case you missed it check out our weapons and gear page on bungie net and the trailer below wait a second we re giving warlocks what gauntlets that spread poison through hordes of enemies i want some the ability to shift using mask of bakris looks pretty sweet for hunters in just a little over a month you may find your new favorite exotic in the wild today we ve got a lot to cover including changes coming to armor mods the kickoff of our festival of the lost art and fashion shows and more let s get started where it all began in the cosmodrome burn bright new light over the last year there s been a lot of great feedback about the new player experience in destiny currently players are given a single mission to become acquainted with some basic gameplay and then let loose in the tower without much direction on where to go or what to do next this led to some confusion as many players didn t exactly know where to start who s that robot that s meticulously cleaning an auto rifle what do i do with these engrams and what s a zavala the team has been working to restructure the onramp for destiny and today we ll be giving a small glimpse into the new light experience starting november players will start in the same way that most all of us have a ghost will be on the hunt for their guardian they ll stumble upon you and they ll revive you for the first time what s different now is that you won t immediately find a ship rather you ll stumble into another guardian in the wild shaw han is his name and he s on a mission with his fireteam to investigate what the hive are up to in the cosmodrome he ll show you the ropes and help you find your way among the gameplay and systems of destiny as a new player you ll spend your first few missions getting acquainted with the state of the world in destiny you ll have opportunity to take a few weapons out for a spin find engrams to try different armor and see our progression systems and have some time to learn how to navigate the user interface to understand quests bounties collections and more all of this will happen before you set foot in the tower and our hope is that this refreshed new light experience will give a much warmer welcome to guardians as they play destiny for the first time with the cosmodrome coming out of the destiny content vault dcv this gave us the perfect opportunity to overhaul our new player experience for veteran players out there this will be a stroll through memory lane while the plaguelands are strictly quarantined per vanguard orders you ll still be able to explore much of what you remember from your first days as a guardian running through the mothyards to collect spinmetal heading down the stairs of the steppes to face off against powerful hive knights and more there will be occasional moments of discovery like stumbling upon a lost sector that you haven t seen before if you re an existing player and would like to go through the new light quest it will also be available to you on november we re excited to see how new players react to our revamped new light experience and for many of you to get your boots back on the ground in the cosmodrome eyes up guardian mod modifications we re a little over a month out from beyond light thirty-three days to be precise we have quite a bit to cover between now and then from sandbox updates to how your various economies are being updated sandbox is always a hot topic of discussion and today we ll be diving a bit deeper into the ways you customize your gameplay experience through armor mods armor mods are used to elevate your reload speeds ability regen and more to higher levels in november some of the mods you commonly use are being tuned some mods will be buffed while others will be removed all together here we re going to dive into a patch note preview of sorts with snippets of developer commentary from the development team throughout energy type requirementsall of the weapon-oriented armor mods i e hand cannon loader fusion rifle ammo finder etc have been changed to be any energy type as a result of the above change all arc charged with light mods now activate their second perk if you have any other arc mod equipped on the same armor piece or if you have any other arc charged with light mod socketed in any other armor piece you are wearing developer commentary removing the energy type requirements from weapon-focused mods has been a consistent piece of community feedback since armor launched however doing so meant that every mod socket would be displaying three times as many mods at a time which would become cumbersome enhanced mod rebalancing all mods that have an enhanced version of that mod i e enhanced hand cannon loader have had the base mods efficacy increased to match that of the enhanced version of the mod as a result those enhanced mods have been deprecated and the base mods energy costs have been adjusted upward slightly but are still lower than the equivalent enhanced mods some mods have moved to different slots to create more competition for mod sockets across armor pieces for example the fast ready mods have moved to the arms socket developer commentary we consistently see feedback that players often don t start feeling the impact of mods until they have an enhanced mod or two non-enhanced mods socketed so to resolve both issues we decided to raise the floor on the effectiveness of all mods to the point where players were more likely to feel their impact and to deprecate the two tiers of mods this should also make having two different mods in the same category say hand cannon loader and shotgun loader socketed at the same time more appealing than it was previously where players often needed to double-stack the same mod to feel like they are getting any benefit in essence we are making enhanced mods cheaper and more accessible and deprecating the lesser mods raid mods starting in season the last wish garden of salvation and the upcoming beyond light raid armors will now drop with a fifth dedicated armor mod socket that is exclusively for the mods related to that raid last wish and garden of salvation armor acquired prior to season will not have this dedicated armor socket but will still be able to use the mods related to that raid in the new legacy armor mod socket anti-taken mods from last wish will only function in the last wish raid anti-hive mods from the leviathan raid will be deprecated anti-fallen raid mods from scourge of the past will be deprecated developer commentary the decision to give the raid armors a fifth mod socket dedicated solely to its raid mods should not only make the raid armors a more valuable reward but also should compensate for the restriction on the usage of these raid mods with the ability to use that armor to craft your build both in and out of the raid regarding the deprecation of the anti-hive and anti-fallen mods and the restriction of the anti-taken mods to last wish this is something that we ve had our eye on for a while we consistently get feedback that faction-specific mods are highly unbalanced outside of the content they were intended to work in in this case the raids which are being moved into the dcv because these are useful with any instance of a combatant race activity designers and sandbox designers were constantly having to be aware of how these mods would impact the play of those activities they have proven to be problematic in gambit creating a clear divide between the haves and the have-nots and have significantly reduced the challenge of dungeons with the raids that provided the source for these mods going into the dcv provides we have the opportunity to gracefully remove these mods and their long-reaching consequences last wish which was designed and balanced with its anti-taken mods in mind will remain a part of the game and continue to reward players with its mods however to prevent those far-reaching consequences mentioned above we are aligning those mods with the other raid mods and making them function only in the raid that they drop from we ve had a positive response to the more mechanic-focused mods from garden of salvation and future raids will have mods more like those combat mods all armor released in beyond light and season all last wish and garden of salvation armor acquired starting in season and all armor exotic armor pieces including those already possessed by players will have a combat style mod socket in season this socket will accept all charged with light and warmind cell mods all armor armor acquired during seasons - have had their seasonal mod sockets replaced with a single unified legacy mod socket that can socket all charged with light mods all warmind cell mods all nightmare hunt mods all garden of salvation mods and all last wish mods and with that we ve come to an end for our armor mod patch note preview in the coming weeks

extension of season of arrivals noting that we d be adding a few fun things between september and the new november launch date of beyond light first we featured some double ordeal loot on lake of shadows this week drifter has been upping the ante with triple infamy next week lord saladin returns with triple valor themed weapons and armor and his pinnacle power bounty rewards don t go in thinking it will be easy to snag some loot though control is the name of the game and power is enabled if you haven t risen through the pinnacle band yet you may find yourself facing a raid boss or two on the other team iron bannerstarts am ptends am ptthere will be a few more weeks with increased rewards for vanguard crucible and gambit so stay tuned for announcements talking tech preparing for beyond lightwith beyond light on fast approach it s time to shift our twab gears a little today we ll be talking through some of the back-end changes that will be coming to destiny on november to guide us through this process we re passing the mic to destiny engineering director david aldridge daldridge when destiny launched three years ago we had no idea that in we d announce a new trilogy of expansions among other surprises we didn t anticipate at the time we thought destiny s arc would look a lot more like destiny a couple of expansions and then a sequel we learned many lessons from the transition to destiny and from shipping curse of osiris warmind forsaken the year- seasons and shadowkeep when we evaluated those lessons we decided not to pursue a destiny but instead to reinvest everything in destiny and make it all that it can be check out our longer writeup on this choice here to support that strategy we ve made several tech investments to help us sustainably evolve the game for years to come and some of those investments are arriving in beyond light many of these changes are under the hood and won t affect your experience except insofar as they help us deliver you more and better destiny in the future but some may result in neat improvements curious behavior differences or bugs this means that on november some places and things will feel a little like sliders only s kids will get this so we d like to give you a rundown of some of the changes and possible side effects we shifted our mission scripting model to run on the physics host instead of the mission host more details on this split here in the interview with matt segur in the long run this change will give designers options to create more novel mission mechanics by giving the mission scripting environment full access to the game state instead of the much more limited access the mission host had for example the physics host knows exactly where enemy combatants are and what actions they recently performed while the mission host only knew how many combatants were alive in a squad and what that squad was generally trying to accomplish in beyond light we re only launching the foundations of this system and we look forward to evolving and leveraging it in the future what you might notice the new scripting environment changed many behaviors in complex ways and you may see interesting behavior changes or bugs in pre-beyond-light missions and public events and similar that were originally built and tested on the previous system we ve tested these missions heavily and stamped out many bugs but some will undoubtedly slip through we ll be monitoring and fixing remaining bugs over time in some cases these issues were more severe for example they caused the prophecy dungeon to be unavailable temporarily we re all excited for its triumphant return slated for the end of this year one other cool new feature in this area is face-to-face joins in social spaces so you can now fireteam up with tower friends without a long tower reload we revamped our content building and patching pipeline for speed and install size with the tremendous size of destiny our complete shippable content builds were frequently taking north of hours we made investments to bring that down to sub- hours which resulted in a bunch of changes to our content and patching formats we also took on work to allow us to cull content that we ve upgraded or replaced our previous patching system had limited capabilities here due to trying to minimize patch sizes and other constraints and the current destiny install has a significant amount of accreted dead content e g assets in the base install that were replaced in later patches what you might notice due to all these changes beyond light will be a full re-download on all platforms we know this will be painful for those with slower or metered internet connections and we re sorry about that to help mitigate this we re planning to enable beyond light preloads sometime in the evening of november pacific time which should give everyone at least hours to download before the gates open destiny 's install size shrinks by - due to a combination of culling unused or replaced content install size optimizations and moving some content to the destiny content vault destiny s install size will shrink to between and gb depending on platform a reduction of to these improvements should also help us control install size better in the coming years we hope to use these much faster builds to accomplish two things help us ship mission-critical fixes faster when game-breaking bugs arise reduce our overall ship pipeline depth enabling us to work on destiny releases closer to their ship dates so we can react to fresher information about what s happening in the live game for example historically each of our seasons has had to get deep into production before the preceding season launched preventing us from reacting to learnings from that preceding season these tech improvements should give us - more weeks of flexibility on a seasonal scale helping us pivot more quickly in some cases we rebuilt our character face system we know that how your guardians look is important to you and we ve long wanted to add more player customization to destiny our original system for player faces had some combinatoric content authoring problems for example every decal had to be authored completely custom for each player face permutation this prevented us from extending this area of the game with more content and features we ve upgraded to a significantly more capable system with e g runtime decal projection which we hope to leverage for more player customization options in the future as part of this process we reviewed the existing player models with our diversity committee and employee resource groups in the studio to make small tweaks to existing player heads we re also building a list of guardian face shapes we should bring to the game in the future in order to increase guardian diversity in destiny with the long-term goal of enabling everyone to imagine themselves as their guardian what you might notice your guardian s face may look a bit different we relit portions of edz and nessus during the early stages of beyond light production the lighting and skies teams had a desire to provide a visual refresh to the two remaining d year destinations edz and nessus as they enter their fourth year in rotation to that end the teams performed relights and global lighting updates to a number of locations on both destinations what you might notice different lighting on existing destinations the changes are intentional and are meant to bring the visual quality of these spaces up to our current lighting standards while providing a fresh coat of paint for some of our year locations we hope you enjoy these updates to some familiar locations when you explore edz and nessus this november we re excited to leverage these improvements to redouble our efforts on destiny and we aim to make destiny still feel like your home away from home thanks -david aldridgep s congratulations on making it to the end of this long and nerdy love letter if your passion for all things destiny tech is not yet spent you may enjoy the reddit ama that destiny engineering manager chris kosanovich and i did a

       " Document(page_content=\"this week at bungie we re making the most of your ghosts last week a new exotic became available to add to your collection and we celebrated destiny s birthday i m still keeping an eye out for pictures of attempts at making that cake things are a little quieter this week which makes it a great time to take advantage of the double rewards being offered for completions of the ordeal this week you love to see it when a bug becomes a feature speaking of upcoming features customizable ghostsa guardian s ghost is their most trusted ally and is tasked with keeping them in the fight your ghost isn t just in charge of bringing you back from the brink it also comes with some perks and a wide range of cool looks to choose from we have some changes planned for your floaty friends and asked designer mina jasinski to tell us about what her team is doing to improve how you customize your ghosts mina jasinski ghosts have always been important partners to our guardians in the destiny universe but they haven t received any meaningful updates in quite some time to allow ghosts to truly shine as the useful and interesting companions we d like them to be we decided it was time to give them a bit of an overhaul in destiny beyond light ghosts have received a system update which shares some functionality to what was done with armor in shadowkeep here s a brief outline of what to expect ghost shells will now have energy levels and access to mods with various energy costs instead of being pre-loaded with specific perks this treatment has been applied to all ghosts outside of the generalist shell so you can use your favorite ghost shells regardless of tier a selection of mods will be available on all ghost shells by default while the remaining ones will be obtainable via various gameplay sources information on where to find these mods can be learned from collections ghost mods will be obtained from gameplay reward loops and will not be purchasable from eververse ghosts now have four mod slots three are unlocked by default and the fourth is unlocked by masterworking the ghost shell one of our goals with this update was to separate visuals from functionality we wanted any ghost shell to be viable and still have access to highly useful mods regardless of tier or source you'll be able to select your favorite ghost shell based on appearance without any detriment to your experience whether you purchase a ghost shell from eververse earn it from the newest raid or pull an old favorite out of collections your ghost will have access to all the same mods across your account from there you can increase energy levels on your favorite ghost shells and set each of them up with different mod combinations of your choosing as mentioned above ghosts will now have access to a total of four mod slots each with their own unique mod selection there will be an experience mod slot a tracking mod slot an economic mod slot and an activity mod slot the last of which is unlocked when the ghost is masterworked at energy you ll be able to mix and match mods from these categories however you like with respect to energy limits mod slots each have a selection of mods that can be combined to fit your playstyle for example a crucible-focused player who wants to grind out materials and earn xp towards their seasonal rewards track might choose guiding light meager glimmer booster and lesser core harvest crucible there are a variety of combinations that can be set up on different ghosts to suit whatever goals you might be chasing at the time for those wondering what will happen to the old ghost perks most have been brought forward largely unchanged as default unlocked mods in some cases such as the destination-specific material or cache trackers those mods have been transformed into globally effective non-destination-specific versions of themselves for better utility energy costs for those mods now reflect the increased flexibility and the mods must be earned from various vendor engrams kill tracker and leviathan boss kill perks will remain intrinsic only on their specific ghost shells even with these changes you ll still be able to build most of the popular exotic perk combinations that were available previously such as guiding light and treasure hunter along with a plethora of new combinations we hope that these changes allow you to interact with your ghost more meaningfully and help you to set up a variety of ghost shells that suit you in various playstyles and activities honoring a friendnext week we have a tribute going live in game to honor one of our dear friends at vicarious visions who passed away last year matt helsom the weekly reset will include a director message that will send you to mars for a short quest to honor mr helsom he worked closely with teams at both bungie and vv on various projects during our partnership and we wanted to memorialize his contributions

higher difficulty options note we re also looking to add adept weapons to strikes in a future season we ll have updates closer to season on what to expect gambitas covered last week gambit and gambit prime will be consolidated into a single mode we have some additional details on specific rule changes as well as development notes from the team on how things are changing and the goals behind them hi gambiteers we wanted to give you an explanations of rules changes coming to gambit in november as well as a key update from last week first some goals we wrote down before we started build a more approachable gambit prime keeping the one-round format with a longer round but without the gambit prime armor perks rebalance the motes phase to last of each match rather than half of the match speed up the primeval fight compared to gambit prime to give more of the feeling of a boss rush we started with the gambit prime encounters full stop however without the reaper buffs the large bosses that come in enemy waves were too tanky so we pulled them all down to miniboss or elite the pacing should feel like how gambit feels for a pickup group or how prime feels for a fully kitted team we also playtested the having the motes phase target a score of and or have a heavier mote drain but this allowed organized teams to steamroll even more effectively not less so we pulled back to the current gambit prime mote target and drain we started with the gambit prime blockers but pulled the taken captain from the blocker lineup as he proved a little too potent for a -mote blocker we replaced him with the phalanx who can be tough to kill but not as lethal since we don t have the armor perks we also had to remove the -mote giant blocker we kept the invasions during mote phases at three just like gambit prime but pulled back the minimum time between invasions during mote phases from seconds to seconds it never feels good to get invaded back-to-back for the boss fight we started with the gambit primeval fight removed the timed slayer buffs increased the primeval health and potency of the slayer buff given by when killing envoys we respawn the envoys every damage done to the primeval so if you get invaded and the primeval is healed a lot you have the opportunity to get more slayer buffs and catch up the fight length ends up somewhere in between the original gambit and gambit prime so we adjusted the invasion timer during the primeval phase to match right in between gambit and gambit prime timing so overall this mode will be a little quicker than gambit prime mostly due to shortening of the boss phase and the removal of the larger bosses from the fronts but one that still gives that great gambit feeling that you all love we see you re hungry for info and we re excited to bring the heat as we approach beyond light we ll have more details on how your weekly rituals are changing economy eververse sandbox and more we re looking forward to talking about things like solo queue iron banner but we have a few things left to tie up as we approach launch stay tuned triumph trackerslast week we announced some changes coming to triumphs in november various triumphs and seals

year you may have also noticed that the contender s ghost shell from prestige leviathan has become available through a triumph in the last few days an issue came to light that the contender s shell perks also lost their loot lockouts combined with some raid encounters that could be completed in under five minutes this led to an incredibly quick way to earn bright engrams which further increased legendary shard and glimmer earn rates as such the seeker of brilliance perk has been temporarily disabled our current goal is to have a hotfix in early august that adds the weekly lockout back to this specific perk once we have more information on an expected patch date we ll let you know via bungiehelp on twitter as a note the seeker of opulence perk remains active if you re looking to round

take down the almighty in destiny s first live in-game event we followed that up with a mighty salvo of virtual launches in the form of media articles and a stream to showcase the future of destiny

decipher their intentions she needs your help oh and did we mention there is a brand new dungeon prophecy is free to all players and transports you into a strange dimension to seek out the ix it s got some real rainbow road vibes too here s a peek the future is bright and full of new challenges to tackle we hope to see you out there match made in heavenby the time that this twab is published a few changes to crucible matchmaking will be live matchmaking based on player skill has been removed from all playlists except elimination survival and survival freelance trials of osiris will continue to be matched based on the number of wins on your passage we are doing this to respond to community feedback shorten queue times for players improve connection quality of matches provide more places where the outcome of the match isn t as important as enjoying the experience play into the strengths of crucible being a bombastic frenetic action game the pursuit of glory points in survival and attempting to go flawless in trials of osiris will allow those playlists to reinforce that the outcome of matches are important and keep the stakes high we want the rest of the crucible to be less of a high-stakes environment where players can have a more relaxed experience and just enjoy the destiny multiplayer sandbox we will continue to monitor feedback and game data around these changes if we decide to make any further adjustments we ll let you know counted you one of my crewthe destiny dev team has a quick update on a change we are making to the dredgen title destiny dev team hey everyone as you may have read here we made some changes to the world loot pool as a result a few of the legendary weapons in the playing for keeps collection badge no longer have a reward source in the game while we still strongly believe that gear collection is a critical part of what it means to earn and wear a title we re going to remove the playing for keeps badge from the dredgen title requirements in an update next week while not trivial the badge didn t represent the challenging portions of earning the title we feel removing this requirement doesn t reduce the meaning of wearing dredgen over your head that said we don t like making changes to titles as their complexity and depth is what gives them meaning but in this case the long-term weapon health outweighs a small change to the title we know you have a lot of questions about how our destiny content vault announcement this week will affect other triumphs and titles we will have more details for you soon thank you and keep sending us feedback as we strive to make a meaningful evolving world in destiny new threadswe have a new item from bungie rewards available to anyone brave enough to defeat the new dungeon before the end of

and remind the next generation of lgbtqia youth that hope is out there and it will get better we also have some words from the bungie diversity committee speaking to the design of the pin diversity comittee our pride pin was specifically designed to include black and brown stripes in an effort to be inclusive and show support for people of color within the lgbtqia community in that spirit we want to continue our support for all intersectional communities including lgtbqia individuals who are also part of the black community currently fighting against racial oppression demanding justice and equality we can support the black lives matter movement and the lgbtqia community at the same time because without the leadership and heroism of transgender black and brown individuals like marsha p johnson and sylvia rivera today's lgbtqia rights would not exist and so now is a time to do more to help both rather than dividing our efforts if you snag a pin you ll also receive a code for the

and more coming on june see you then mixing a green thumb with a bumper jumperso we heard you like patch note previews they re short sweet and to the point this topic though needs a bit more time to get through today staff designer lisa brown takes center stage to walk us through the upcoming controller remapping feature that the team has been working on lisa greetings guardians i m lisa a staff designer on the sandbox team here at bungie and i m going to give an overview of the controller remapping feature for gameplay actions that will be coming to destiny for all players in the season of redacted although we have controller presets in destiny these aren t enough to meet basic accessibility guidelines for motor control and mobility we ve been working with some amazing accessibility consultants cherry rae thompson https www cherryrae com and ian hamilton http ian-hamilton com blog to create support for remapping buttons on the controller here i ll give an overview of how to use the feature what it can and can t do and then share some setups that have been used by various bungie employees as examples as a quick note all of the below examples will be shown using xbox button layouts overviewplayers can create a custom controller layout by going to the controller section of the settings screen and choosing button layout a custom option is available in the list on this screen you ll be able to customize mappings for gameplay actions on your character in vehicles and in general settings like emotes and interacting with prompts if you re like me and you typically use a preset other than default you can use the reset button to start from one of those presets to rebind a button select the button mapping next to the action you want and the next screen will allow you to input the button you want to remap to verbs verbs verbsone of the challenges with controller remapping in destiny is that we have a lot of player verbs think of verbs as actions throwing grenades triggering your super jumping sprinting sliding etc with pc remapping there s a whole keyboard at your disposal to map buttons on the controller though there s only so many buttons and we have many more verbs than buttons to solve this we allow the player to map an action not just to a button but also a type of input our three supported input types are press a standard button press for example crouching on the default layout long press requires holding down the button for a brief period of time to initiate the action for example casting barricade or rift as a titan or warlock double press pressing a button twice in succession to initiate an action for example dodging for hunters as an example some of our exotic weapons borealis symmetry hard light etc have an alternate weapon action which has typically been activated by holding the reload button now this can be mapped separately to a different button or different input for example i like to change it from long press x to double press x now when i want to switch symmetry s firing mode i double press the x button for the double press input type you can also increase the amount of time between button presses for it to register as a double press this option is on the main controller page chord supportin addition to mapping actions to an individual button we also support mapping to chords meaning two buttons pressed simultaneously in the default layout in destiny pressing the left and right bumpers together to execute your super is an example of a chord here s a custom layout example where a player has mapped some of the basic character options to just the face button using chords fire xtoggle zoom press yreload press a xalternate weapon action long press a x melee press b ygrenade double press bsuper press a bjump press aconstraints and caveatsalthough this feature is a step towards greater motor accessibility in destiny it is still limited in what it can do for example this controller remapping feature is limited to gameplay actions not ui input or menu navigation one motor accessibility challenge are inputs that require the player to hold down a button we have options to switch between holds and toggles for some of our actions zoom sprint crouch but we were not able to address all cases examples weapon firing class jump ability charging grenades drawing a bow etc we opted for flexibility in allowing players to map any action to any button and input combination but that flexibility means there are some combinations that may give unexpected results for the player example if you map melee to press x and some other action to long press x the melee action resolves before the duration to detect a long press so the player would always melee and never do the other action there is no individualized error verification for these cases this update was just focused on controller remapping so there are some mappable options that appear here that are not yet available for keyboard remapping for example individual mappings for different class abilities and some warlock abilities like phoenix dive or icarus dash our chord support is for simultaneous press of two buttons only it does not detect if you press one button hold it down and then press another unlike our presets there s no dynamic controller preview image for the custom layout bungie exampleshere are a few examples of custom mappings that some of our bungie players enjoy i ll start with my own i m typically a jumper player but i also have a problem with melee on right stick press even though it s a faster input for my hand to reach i am a stress-clicker and many a perfect shot line up has been ruined by a wayward melee i needed to move my melee action to something more intentional so i put it on a and moved super back up to the double bumper chord i put player highlight back on right stick press but made my finisher double press a i also made my alternate weapon action double press x instead of long press because i prefer that input another example is from a left-handed player who typically uses mirror but wanted a true left-handed experience and so swapped the function of the face buttons with the d-pad buttons actions like reload jump crouch etc were now on the d-pad buttons while emotes were mapped to the face buttons a third bungie employee really wanted to recreate a classic halo experience in destiny he started with the default layout and switched zoom to a toggle on right stick grenade on left trigger melee on b and crouch on left stick press he then mapped super to a jump on left bumper and class ability on right bumper he also chose to leave heavy attack light attack and guard actions only used in third person modes like roaming supers mapped to their original right trigger right bumper and left trigger mappings we hope that this feature will make destiny more accessible and flexible but do note that this is but one step on destiny s journey to improve accessibility across the game we re excited to bring another form of accessibility to destiny and will be watching as this first iteration goes live last call it s pretty much closing time you don t have to go home but you should definitely get your triumphs done before the servers go offline next tuesday player support has a full roundup this is their report closing out season of the worthywhen

rasputin is at full power we're as ready as we'll ever be now eclipsing our own sun is a stark reminder that a great threat approaches eyes up what's next destiny has been a shared pastime for long enough now to have established some strong traditions each year we spend in service of the guardians we can mark our calendars by the next development milestone we ll reach or the next event we ll attend to spread the news some of us have had the remarkable privilege to travel the world and meet some of you fine people to talk about what comes next this year finds us all in a scenario that puts us all very far away from business as usual basically all flights originating from our tower are grounded development of destiny continues only we are all working from the safety of our homes we have exciting news to share with you about our plans but it won t happen at some fancy convention under hot lights instead we'll use the internet if you are familiar with the rituals and cycles that mark a year in the life of a guardian you must be curious as to when we'll begin a conversation about what is next we can't put a date on that just yet but we will very soon that's a promise we know you're hungry for that news and we're just as eager to deliver it keep your eyes trained on bungie for updates we ll stream our announcements in the usual places you ll learn about the next season of destiny at the same time that we talk about the next chapter in this story that has been unfolding all year long diving deepin recent editions of this week at bungie we ve taken the cue directly from the community on what we should talk about our attention has been focused on your feedback our words have pointed toward what we plan to do to bring the game into alignment with what you ve been talking about with a summary of what we ve promised and some updates on our progress here is production director justin truman justin hey everybody five weeks ago we promised a series of deep dives on the state of destiny and how we plan to change it in season and year we enlisted seven members of the destiny team to provide as much detail as we could and i d encourage you to go back and read any of the topics you may have missed - security cheaters and what we re doing about them - seasons in year reducing fomo and improving bounties - rewards the eververse and transmog - max power levels and the s redacted engram - reload perks and the world loot pool we covered a lot of ground and while we are going to continue to provide updates each week to topics you care about we want to shift our focus in the coming weeks we ve said a lot about changes coming in year but we haven t talked about how year begins very soon we'll do just that i kicked off this series of deep dives with some promises but i want to end the series on a more personal note being unable to go to the office trying to figure out how to keep building this game we love from our laptops and our couches has had me thinking a lot about commitment videogame development is messy evolving destiny in an open transparent way involves showing and shipping plenty of missteps along with the improvements but it continues to be worth it every step of the way because i can honestly say this is the most welcoming most passionate community of players i have encountered in any game we re committed to this game to staying transparent about our plans and to this relationship we have with our community the reasons we started on this journey years ago haven t changed we re committed to building a world anyone can be a part of where everyone can feel powerful and where you might reconnect with old friends or make some new ones so we look forward to continuing this conversation and continuing to evolve destiny

       " Document(page_content=\"this week at bungie something unexpected happened on the way to the moon bunker many of you have been chasing a lie last week you began your hunt with ana successfully defending seraph towers in the winding cove anchor of light and the rupture or watched as your fellow guardians carried the weight you burned through a thousand enemies with your trusty shotgun sadly your quest for answers came to a halt on sunday evening all thanks to a faulty door on the moon s bunker earlier this morning destiny hotfix was released unblocking your journey in finding truth behind the lie while we hate to see a bug ship we re excited to right the ship as quickly as possible now we look to what comes next season of the worthy is winding down which means it s time for a round of previews from the team this week we re hyper focused on legendary engrams and weapon tuning decrypting the futurelast week we did a deep dive on how loot will be evolving season over season with the upcoming addition of a max power level to your gear players have been asking how acquisition methods will be changing we have a breakdown from the destiny dev team on how we re keeping the items you earn from legendary engrams and core activities relevant during a given season today we re going to talk about some changes that are coming in season to the way the world loot pool works because the world pool serves as a baseline of legendary gear that can be earned across different activities we want to update and refresh it seasonally with meta relevant weapons some of which were previously exclusive to specific activities like gambit or crucible this shared pool can also be unwieldy -- if you're looking for a specific roll of a specific weapon a pool too large can make it statistically challenging to find much less with the roll you want starting in season it will be curated both for relevance and overall size to strike a balance between number of rewards and the chance to get a sought-after drop every season gear from previous seasons will be added and any gear that would no longer have a max power level greater than or equal to the current season cap will be cycled out to ensure that drops are power relevant in the current season the world pool for season will consist of the following weapons uriel's gift elatha fr the old fashioned mos epoch iii hawthorne's field-forged shotgun last hope timelines' vertex interference vi dire promise true prophecy jian rifle enigma's draw distant tumulus escape velocity honor's edge gnawing hunger arsenic bite- b main ingredient outrageous fortune truthteller nature of the beast last perdition bad omens night watch toil and trouble wishbringer last dance lonesome long shadow steel sybil z- if you still need a weapon or weapon roll from the current vanguard crucible or gambit playlists that isn t on that list go grab it now lock and reloadalongside the changes to the world loot pool we have some changes coming to destiny s sandbox this week we ll be focused on weapons specifically perk tuning here s a quick breakdown from the team on what to expect reload perk updates we ve observed that players lean towards picking perks that increase their damage e g kill clip or reduce weapon downtime e g outlaw the damage perks were adjusted quite a while back but reload perks still don t feel like choices this tuning pass aims to keep them feeling powerful without being so dominant that no other choices seem viable first some information on the stats that impact reload reload stat - and maps onto an archetype-specific reload animation speed reload duration scale most reload perks also apply a small multiplier to the reload animation so that if reload stat is capped you still see a small speed bump reload empty duration scale as above but only applies if the magazine is empty note that because most weapons have fairly high reload stats decreasing a reload stat bonus from to will still max out the reload stat most of the time and so doesn t slow down the actual reload as much as it seems the following perks that alter these reload stats are being updated outlaw slowed this down a little bit reload stat from to reload duration scale from to feeding frenzy this was strictly better than outlaw so we re changing functionality to be based on number of rapid kills functionality changed to increase reload speed based on number of rapid kills up to with kills reload speed is equal to updated outlaw with kills is faster than outlaw with kills is the fastest reload in the game except alloy mag max possible reload duration scale from to max possible reload stat unchanged at rapid hit gave a huge amount of reload and stability for very little work front-loaded onto the first precision hit we have updated it so that it still feels good but isn t quite as powerful adjusted stacking bonus to give less benefit for the first hit and more with subsequent hits max possible reload stat from to max possible reload duration scale from to max possible stability stat from to drop mag situationally really powerful without a massive drawback as good as a perk but in a magazine column reload duration scale from to just brings it in line with outlaw field prep unchanged but for reference reload stat reload duration scale alloy mag unchanged but for reference reload empty duration scale additionally we re fixing an issue where perks that grant partial weapon ammo did not respect shot count for burst weapons this means that these perks will now work correctly on pulse rifles fusion rifles and burst sidearms so these perks will be more common on those weapon archetypes in the future slideways slideshot ambitious assassin subsistence overflow lead from gold clown cartridge general perk retuning with opening up space by adjusting reload perks we also retuned some other underused perks based on our internal testing and perk popularity and effectiveness data from our internal analytics dynamic sway reduction -- adds stability over time in addition to accuracy this is way more powerful than it sounds reduced reticle movement from stability should now tell players this is working pulse monitor -- take critical damage and you can quickly switch to your now-fully loaded shotgun reload amount from to handling faster swap speed this works on stowed weapons too which was already the case but makes it a lot more useful hipfire grip -- now helps you hit shots closer to ads ranges still doesn't affect damage dropoff or magnetism x aim assist falloff aim assist degrees precision hip fire angle threshold by default when hip-firing a weapon the center of your reticle must be over a target in order to get a crit otherwise aim assist will give you a body shot this change gives you a little leniency so if the center of your reticle is not directly over a target you will still get the crit if you re within this angle has no effect on sniper rifles sneak bow -- actually makes you sneaky now stealth buff now doesn't ping radar when shooting new perksnext season we ll have new perks rolling exclusively on the season of redacted weapons additionally iron banner will be receiving two new perks on two reprised weapons in future seasons these perks will begin to roll on other weapons while we don t want to spoil the fun of discovering and testing new perks we will leave you with the names of upcoming iron banner perks iron grip and iron gaze we are excited to see the community break these perks down when the new season begins upcoming archetype buffs next season we re taking a quick pass on a few weapon archetypes that have been underperforming slug shotguns are underused in pve because they require crits to maximize damage and didn t reward that precision with higher damage per second slug shotgun pve damage high-impact pulse rifles are underused in crucible while they have a very fast optimal ttk that ttk was very hard to achieve so we decided to soften that a little high-impact pulse rifle damage per bullet from to this changes it from crits to crits body to kill a guardian in pvp at most resilience values in analytics we see bows are underused in challenging content and locally we ve observed that it feels terrible when a bow leaves a red bar enemy at low health bow pve damage vs minors future archetype updates we ve been evaluating feedback and our analytics data and while we re not done yet we wanted to touch on three community pain points our current goal is to touch on these in season but we ll be sure to let you know if plans change sniper rifles community feedback has been that revoker and beloved dominate and looking at analytics they account for of sniper rifle usage in the crucible and if we include other low-zoom sniper rifles the number gets even higher we re specifically looking at how zoom translates into ease-of-use for sniper rifles we re investigating changes that make choosing a sniper rifle zoom more of an interesting choice hand cannons we re evaluating the hand cannon subfamilies as an example we re breaking out aggressive hand cannons to let us tune their range independently of the others adaptive auto rifles auto rifles in general are highly represented in crucible but generally feel balanced adaptive auto rifles are a little higher so we re looking at them we re not rolling back the season buff but we re adjusting the tuning a little to give other auto rifle subfamilies a chance to shine moving forward we plan to make more regular weapon balance changes we ll have more to share on cadence and scope later in the know you may have noticed bungiehelp on twitter is freshly verified if you don t follow this account get to it player support

been watching the conversation about season of the worthy and more specifically trials of osiris we wanted to walk through the topics we ve been exploring and give some basic thoughts on what we d like to approach in the future some items below may be addressed in the coming weeks but other may take a season or more to tackle we re having meetings and discussions daily to determine the best course of action in the meantime it s important to us that you know your voices are heard card rewardswe ve been discussing feedback around a lack of incentive for players to go flawless we understand that some players have found the first few games to be more lucrative which we d love to shift to the later games early card token farming as some would call it is something that we are very interested in solving we want to make sure that every destiny player who wants to play trials has something to show for it at the end of a weekend additionally we ve seen feedback that the flawless chest isn t comparable the rewards associated with grinding out nightfalls this is something that we d love to improve upon there are quite a few ways we could approach this and we re currently discussing what would be the best for trials in the long run disconnectionswe ve been investigating an issue that prevented us from enabling rejoin options when trials first launched the short version a player s score could reset if that player left and rejoins the match since we ve resolved this issue we are currently planning to enable rejoin in update additionally our teams are continuing to investigate the rise in error codes since the launch of the season this is one of our top priorities and we ve made some progress in identifying the issue what s left is developing a fix and testing it we want to take the appropriate time here to avoid introducing any further issues into the game fair playwe ve seen reports from players that have encountered cheaters in trials over the last few weekends what follows is a quick update on what we ve been doing to improve your experience and what we re discussing internally for future improvements to restate the note in the intro some of these items may not be addressed for some time as we re in early conversations but we wanted to give you an update of what s going on behind the scenes here at bungie our anti-cheat is not as visible by design as some security products however we regularly detect and remove thousands of malicious accounts from the pvp ecosystem on the front lines we continue to implement new anti-cheat improvements during patch releases we don t include these in the patch notes for obvious reasons and are always investigating new approaches as cheat developers adapt to our latest tech many of the cheats you may find in the wild already have detections and countermeasures deployed or in development with work being done constantly to keep them updated against new threats because cheat developers don t stop we know we have to keep working to improve these systems note this is a tricky line to walk as we don t want to punish any innocent players that may consistently have high stats due to extreme skill game bugs or game logic exploits which bungie considers our fault we are working with our platform partners to identify ways in which we can further strengthen our security we are investigating ways in which we can let you know when your reports have resulted in a permanent ban or a temporary restriction additionally we wanted to give a few tips on information that helps us during our investigations when processing reports from the report suspected cheating contact form important note do not post any of this information publicly not on reddit not on the bungie forums this information should only go in this specific form here s the information we are looking for display name of the known good player is this you a friend of yours display name of the suspect s and any other identifying info you have clan name steam id etc explain what suspicious behavior was observed note the platform the behavior was observed on provide a link to the post-game carnage report pgcr on bungie net and if possible give us links to any video evidence this could be a youtube video or archived twitch stream with timestamps a clip or a video you have recorded and shared via a public sharing service sorry we can t connect to your private google drive or onedrive to view a video i know that some of you out there may find the statement of we re listening to be a repetitive clich of community management but the first step toward taking action is to listen we ve been collecting your feedback and looking to fully understand the root of the perceived issues that are being discussed by players in the wild your voice is important to us and helps us as we walk the path to what s next in destiny we ll be sure to keep you updated on our plans as they become more concrete and we thank you for your continued feedback on the game speaking of the future let s talk about stat trackers back on trackat the beginning of the season changes were introduced to stat trackers to give players more ways to express their achievements in destiny we introduced weekly seasonal and lifetime trackers and these were completely optional to those who might want to have a clean emblem with this overhaul previously featured trackers were removed players were quick to highlight this as a pain point which we re eager to address this week we have a list of the stats we ll be bringing back in update which

anxiety-provoking confusing and stressful because of that it is more important than ever to lift each other up and put the well-being of others especially those who are in need before ourselves it has been encouraging to see communities join together in solidarity to keep themselves and others safe and healthy as a company located in the epicenter of the u s outbreak here in washington state we believe it is important to help our local community through this crisis bungie is grateful to partner with the boys girls club of bellevue bgcb which is doing life-saving work for our local families while all local schools remain closed through the end of april the bgcb is committed to keeping as many of their facilities open as possible to care for children so that parents who must continue to go work are able to do so in addition they are feeding and providing necessary supplies for families in crisis bungie is providing a grant that will enable the bgcb to operate four sites across the bellevue region through the end of april in order to care for our community s most vulnerable low-income and homeless families this care will allow more families to continue earning income and paying their rent while keeping their families fed and healthy and will help to minimize long-term repercussions from this crisis while many of us live in areas that have been encouraged to practice social distancing there are always ways to help your fellow neighbor here are a few things to consider support your local small businesses as an example if your gym is closed please consider retaining your membership so that they can afford to re-open their doors support family-owned restaurants by ordering take-out or search for local fundraisers like gofundme that are providing financial support to restaurant workers artists performers and more that are without work during the shutdowns support your nonprofits many major fundraising activities have been cancelled or postponed if you plan to donate to any organization this year please consider doing it now rather than later many organizations depend on those fundraisers and are in a really tight spot without those funds support families

rasputin s defenses to take on this new threat here is a quick look at some of what you can expect during the new season of destiny before we embark on the first twab of the new season we d like to acknowledge some feedback that we ve been seeing in the wild we had a large change to emblems and stat trackers which we ll be talking about later in the twab we re also seeing some discussion on the new weapons of the season and lack of ritual weapons for vanguard crucible and gambit the team is currently reviewing and discussing the feedback and we will be looking to talk about our goals for weapons in a future twab there are a variety of other topics from eververse to armor mods which we re collecting feedback on and discussing internally as a team while we don t have any specific changes to announce at this time we wanted to make sure you know that we see the feedback and are actively discussing this internally once we have more information we ll be sure to let you know it s been a wild launch week but we re just getting started tomorrow s friday and the day isn t just reserved for x r anymore trials returns and we ve got a bit to talk about to get you prepared trials returnsin case you still haven t heard trials of osiris returns this season the first weekend of action-packed high-stakes pvp starts tomorrow let s set the mood shall we for everyone not familiar with trials of osiris here s a quick rundown of what to expect the game mode is v elimination using the same rules showcased in the last few seasons the key difference is that saint- will be calling the matches and now your power matters you must be power to participate your trials passage or card is your ticket in try to get as many wins as possible before you hit three losses and have to start over earn a flawless victory by winning seven matches with no losses you can reset your trials passage at any time by accessing the item in your quests or on the trials of osiris activity node one change from the previous trials of osiris is that there are no boons that you will need to purchase and apply instead there will be five different trials passages you can choose from that offer different bonuses built in like forgiving one loss per run or granting bonus experience from wins that increase with the number of wins on a ticket players will also be able to earn trials tokens to turn into saint- to increase their reputation and earn trials engrams any tokens that a player doesn t spend that week will be removed when trials ends at the next weekly reset so spend them if you got them we have more details on these features and how trials of osiris will work in our full trials of osiris help article trials of osiris will match you with opponents based on your connections and how many wins you have logged on your current passage to submit yourselves to these trials you must form your own fireteam now go and shine bright as beacons of light b in preparation for trials of osiris our security team has been hard at work protecting the integrity of the crucible we re always working to improve our defenses against cheats and other malicious activity recently we ve improved our methods for combating those who feel like they don t have to play by the rules we will be keeping a close eye on trials of osiris where the stakes are even higher new server-side security features have been deployed specifically for trials of osiris and we hardened our network layer to make it more resilient to network manipulation we ve also increased our staffing to be able to handle the review and banning of cheaters because the ongoing battle with cheating is fought primarily with information we can t go into exact details on our methods which might tip off would-be cheaters on ways to get around them we can assure you we take cheating seriously and will continue to work to both prevent it and punish any offenders if you do come across anyone you suspect of cheating please report them in-game as well as online with our suspected cheater report form eyes up tracker trackingin season of the worthy all emblems have been converted to use our new stat trackers that means all emblems will be inspectable and can have trackers equipped or not when designing this system our overall goal is to provide players more ways and options to show off their accomplishments our first selection of stats were determined by prioritizing stats that represented a skill that could be improved week-over-week or season-over-season and be an accomplishment that players would want to display that was meaningful to other players because of that some stats that couldn t be completed or improved any longer weren t included we believe in these requirements in principle but strictly applying them retroactively unfairly removed your ability to show off accomplishments that you could flaunt in seasons prior it was a change made with good intention but was the wrong way to roll out a new system we ve identified some stats that can be added back in a future patch and wanted to share them with you we are currently planning to add these stat trackers back in an update later in the

       " Document(page_content=\"this week at bungie we prepare for the worthy we re just five short sleeps from season of the worthy last week you completed the empyrean foundation event lighting a beacon for guardians to follow back to the lighthouse and trials of osiris on tuesday we unveiled season of the worthy all up if you haven t seen the trailer there is a new threat for you to confront bungie net also has a dedicated page for the new season jam-packed with information to get you up to speed before next tuesday s launch before we get started with the rest of the twab i wanted to take a quick moment to highlight another blog post that went live earlier today in response to the covid- coronavirus outbreak our teams have been working hard to build out an infrastructure that would enable bungie employees to support destiny and the impending season release safely from remote locations season of the worthy is still planned to release on march followed by the return of trials of osiris on march while there is a possibility that this change could affect our patching cadence in the short term we will be sure to keep players informed about those schedules as much as possible stay tuned to bungie and bungiehelp for any future updates now we have some housekeeping to do before we arm an ancient warmind let s get to it trialsreturnsmoments after the announcement that trials of osiris would return with season of the worthy we witnessed numerous guardians sharing their favorite memories from this beloved corner of the pvp endgame moments of spectacle joy heartbreak insanity and everything in between trials of osiris was the source of some awesome community highlights a thing that some of our newer guardians may have yet to experience we d love to see more of your stories and bring them into the scene using the hashtag trialsreturns share your favorite clips from destiny s trials of osiris you can post them to twitter upload them to youtube and even post them to our community creations page we ll round up our favorites to be featured in next week s twab if your video is selected you and your fireteam will take home a movie of the week emblem make sure to include links to the bungie net profiles of every team member power gainswith each new season you re faced with new challenges that require a bit of power acquisition to take on in season of worthy you ll be challenged in not only trials of osiris but in legendary lost sectors and grandmaster nightfalls here s a quick update from the dev team on what s changing on day-one and what our plans are for a mid-season update dev team we re raising the cap for gear drops points powerful gear will now drop up to with pinnacle drops going up to the soft cap has also been effectively raised points gear drops from nearly all sources will continue to be upgrades until power and powerful reward sources will not be required to progress to we re looking to present an element of gear progression available each season as well as prepare underlying systems for future updates like the forthcoming one for legendary weapons mentioned by luke smith in the director s cut weapons forever section we re also looking to make some quality of life updates in the pinnacle band starting in coming mid-season we ll be upgrading some existing powerful rewards to pinnacle rewards these are the weekly crucible strike and gambit challenges as well as the weekly clan engram with this change we want to increase the total number of pinnacle power sources in the game broaden pinnacle drop access as well as increase the pools of items that can drop in the pinnacle band slot imbalances can also affect pinnacle progression when we say slot imbalance this could be explained as those times you have a chest piece drop from pinnacle sources a few times in a row we ve been looking at player feedback for some time and are investigating a few approaches to the problem space we re looking to have an update on that at a later date until then we hope the additional sources will help you on your climb while we have the dev team here they also wanted to give an update on artifact power for trials of osiris dev team with trials just around the corner we wanted to address the artifact power problem as quickly as we could as luke said last week our short-term fix is to disable the artifact's power bonus while in trials and iron banner unfortunately season of the worthy has already been released for certification so we won't be able to disable the artifact's power for the first trials weekend we have the fix in-house to disable it and are testing it this week and hope to deploy it on tuesday march we really wish we could have gotten it in for the launch weekend but we also expect the first trials weekend to be the one impacted by the artifact the least players will have much less time to increase their artifact power so the majority will be close to each other outside of pinnacle drops our long-term plan is to enable a power cap for trials and iron banner and we're investigating the work required for this this will roll out no earlier than midway through season of the worthy but we don't have a firm date yet we'll make sure to communicate it when we do we also plan to look at the damage curves for power-enabled pvp modes to determine what if any adjustments should be made assuming we discover it s necessary the timeline for a change is still tbd with both changes we plan to provide more detailed write-ups before they go live explaining the details of the change and the design philosophy behind why we are making those decisions just for clarity i'll echo luke's statement from last week we're going to disable the artifact power bonus in trials and iron banner until we can implement a new power cap system for those playlists i hope you all enjoy season of the worthy and may your run to the lighthouse be swift and merciless season of the worthy eververse updatewith the turn of each season we hope to keep players up to date on how the eververse store is evolving this season we have a few changes concerning bright engrams and a new path to directly purchasing some previously featured eververse items bright engramsin season of the worthy bright engrams will no longer be available for purchase from the eververse store as said in the february director s cut we want players to know what something costs before they buy it bright engrams don t live up to that principle so we will no longer be selling them on the eververse store though they will still appear on the free track of the season pass this season we are continuing to focusing our efforts on direct purchasing through the eververse store daily rotation of returning itemsin the place of bright engrams a new module will become available on the eververse store starting in season of the worthy this daily-rotating module will feature one item from a small selection of ships sparrows ghosts and finishers that were offered in previous seasons these items will be available to purchase directly for silver at a discount from the original price aside from these changes there aren t any other major shifts coming for eververse we ll be monitoring the conversation through launch and beyond and will be sure to update you before any large changes come here s a quick preview of some upcoming items coming with season of the worthy hunter finisher titan finisher warlock finisherthe final preview of patch notes over the last few weeks we ve been giving some previews how your sandbox will be

       " Document(page_content='this week at bungie trials is back on the menu it s been an exciting week you all came together and donated your stockpiles of fractaline to the ongoing effort to build the new lighthouse and usher in the return of trials of osiris next season as soon as the final stage was complete you were invited to survey the completion of the project and light the beacon we saw your signal as our cue to release this developer insight video confirming what many have been speculating for a while now to follow the video luke smith wrote another director s cut that covered a few topics including our philosophy on seasons and some challenges in sustaining a game with weapons that last forever similar to the three-part epic he put out last year it contains a lot of important info you won t want to miss subclass changeswith the return of trials and a new season on the way we re planning to shake things up with some changes to your guardian abilities the dev team has the details so i ll let them do the talking dev team hey guardians trials is coming back and the combat systems team has been hard at work preparing destiny for its arrival we ve made a number of big changes to the abilities sandbox and instead of simply dropping them all in the patch notes we wanted to take this opportunity to offer some transparency for our decision-making process before we begin we want to give a big shout out to the data scientists here at bungie they provide us with mountains of valuable data to sift through from the win rates of each subclass in each crucible game mode to the kills-per-minute of each weapon on each platform in each pve activity this data allows us to make sure we re making informed decisions when balancing the game it allows us to separate the perceived power of abilities weapons and armor from their true objective power but the data doesn t always tell the whole story and we believe strongly that perceived power and community sentiment are just as important as cold hard data even as trials returns we re committed to maintaining a fun and fair sandbox for both pvp and pve and we considered data for all game modes when making adjustments warlock meleewarlocks have long been at a disadvantage in melee fights because it takes them slightly longer than titans and hunters to recover from making a melee attack so next season we re extending the warlock s basic melee range by one meter to a total of meters warlocks will still melee slightly slower than the other classes but they ll now have a one-meter advantage if you can use this window to land the first melee attack in a slap fight you ll likely emerge victorious we feel this is a more interesting solution to melee disparity than homogenizing all of the melee attacks and we ll be studying the data as it rolls in to make sure it s balanced titan barricadesa titan s barricade is incredibly powerful in trials because you can use it to safely resurrect your fallen teammates next season we re creating counters to the barricade while also raising its health from hp to hp barricades will now take extra damage from special-ammo weapons anti-barrier weapons and certain heavy weapons this change makes barricades sturdier while giving opposing players the option to use their special ammo to bring down the barricade more quickly the following weapons now do extra damage to barricades sniper riflesgrenade launcherslinear fusion riflesmachine gunstrace riflesanti-barrier weaponsthe following weapons now do extra damage to barricades shotgunsfusion riflesyou ll see yellow damage numbers when hitting a barricade with a counter weapon which always feels good one-shot abilitieswith the introduction of the hunter s weighted knife in season of dawn each class now has a neutral-game ability that can kill pvp opponents in one hit we ve taken a pass at all of the one-shot abilities to tune their risk reward factor we ll warn you that some these changes look extreme on paper but we made a point to make sure these abilities retained their overall feel for the titan s three shoulder charge abilities we reduced the auto-targeting angle by that might sound like a lot but acrobatic titans could previously auto-target to make an instant -degree turn we also adjusted the lunge distance to m for both targeted and untargeted lunges targeted lunges were previously m while untargeted lunges were previously m these changes make for a more consistent experience while lunging for the hunter s weighted knife we ve reduced its tracking significantly and created new tracking tech that will make the knife more faithful to its initial throw trajectory as for the warlock s handheld supernova we ve made a number of changes to bring this ability in line with the other one-shot abilities while part of hhsn s strength lies in its pairing with the contraverse hold exotic gauntlets which are also being tuned this season our data indicated that even without contraverse hold handheld supernova needed to be adjusted here are the changes increased activation time by secondsreduced hold time from seconds to secondsreduced range by tightened horizontal spread of bolts by bolt explosion now does self-damagereduced bolt explosion radius from m to min our playtesting we ve found that the product of these changes is an ability that is still incredibly strong but now has a risk reward ratio commensurate with its power after all this thing can vaporize multiple pvp opponents instantly there s even a bit of silver lining here the tightening of the bolts leads to more concentrated damage at range improving its viability against supers to compensate for this change other elements of the middle voidwalker path are being buffed including the nova warp super which now has increased damage resistance a longer duration and a reduced blink cost general subclass tuningwe ve made changes to a number of subclass paths in an effort to tighten the gameplay balance for example stormcaller top striker bottom and arcstrider bottom have remained dominant in pvp for multiple seasons now consistently beating out all other paths in both win-rate and average efficiency these paths have also ranked among the top pve paths in terms of kills-per-minute we ve adjusted these paths and others to bring them closer to the middle of the pack on the other end of the spectrum paths such as voidwalker bottom nightstalker bottom and striker middle needed some love so we ve taken steps to lift them up in the spirit of transparency we take no joy in nerfing the abilities weapons and armor that we all love to use we wish the answer to keeping the game balanced and fresh was always to buff the underperforming elements but such an approach leads to power creep the slow and steady increase of the average power of everything in the game which trivializes the incredible game modes and encounters that the other teams at bungie work hard to create after all as destiny players ourselves we go home and play the game too and we want the game to be as fun and as healthy as possible that s it from us today you ll find more details about these changes and more when the patch notes drop in early march oh yeah and hunter tripmines are sticky again stay sharp guardians as promised in addition to these explanations there will be patch notes when the new

       " Document(page_content=\"hey everyone setting aside the tricks our memories play on us things are often clearer in hindsight than when we re looking ahead the recent past is clear loaded with learnings from the mistakes we make and the future is fuzzy hopeful and unknown as we readied last year s director s cut we had made a number of changes to the game and wanted to give you all some insight as to why we made those changes each director s cut is a chance to acknowledge and own the learnings from the past when the wounds are fresh and give a glimpse at tomorrow this edition is arriving a little earlier in the development process for how we re thinking about year and beyond and while some of the changes the game needs are clear to us there are others we re still thinking about last summer s payload covered a wide-range of topics that ended up touching on almost the whole game today s dc is going to look in depth at just a couple of topics how our philosophy on seasons is evolving and the problems with weapons that last forever with some additional quick-hit topics at the end this isn t exhaustive we know there s more going on in the game than below and there will be more to talk about later in the year before we look ahead let s look back one more time was about a few things for bungie and destiny asserting our vision for destiny it s an action mmo in a single evolving world that you can play anytime anywhere with your friends it s a game we want to keep building on and to do so with creative and work life sustainability without our team s talents there isn t a destiny and while that seems obvious to say i think it s pretty easy to lose sight of amidst the this was awesome this was not so awesome reactions to entertainment as i covered at length last year the way we built the annual pass wouldn t work for us over the long haul we had a lot of help and person-power from our awesome and now former partners we needed to find a better way forward while preserving the player experience and our business because we are now self-publishing destiny that was a big lift for bungie in when i think about the total scope of that work and the sheer force of will the team demonstrated to deliver in i feel pretty good about what we achieved usually this is where we d list all of the positives but instead let s use the word count to improve on the past and look ahead to the future as we began much of the existential dread of will we make it out of this transition is gone we ve clarified our vision for destiny and are working toward the future with that vision in mind for me personally the drive home each night isn t focused on will bungie survive like before now it s where can destiny go and how can we get there when i came back from the holiday this year something about destiny felt off to me season is to me the best winter season we ve done in destiny but something felt missing and that missing element is what i think we need to focus on throughout and into aspiration a hope or ambition of achieving something the action or process of drawing breath in destiny aspiration is what keeps our game alive it is the air that fills its lungs it is the breath that gives the game meaning aspiration can be about entering destiny for the first time and feeling the potential of what you could become it can be about the pursuits in front of you or it can also be pvp players looking over the horizon and seeing the lighthouse and its treasures awaiting them if they pass the trials aspiration isn t something reserved for the elite or the engaged it s for everyone although when i listen to players express the feeling that there s so much to do and none of it matters i feel that pain it s about the potential of a game to be more than something that just fills your time it s about having goals and working toward something that matters to you i m not so na ve as to think we can make something that matters to everyone we all have different values goals and time but i do think destiny can do a better job of enabling players to set short- medium- and long-term goals to work toward as a player aspiration is something i feel so strongly about it s the difference between a game i fall in love with and a game i consume like junk food last year we started thinking about aspiration and what is missing from destiny the gaping burning-eye-shaped hole is something i d felt since we set trials aside early in d its return is part of a bigger goal for destiny moving into and beyond we need to refuel aspiration in destiny and a bunch of what we re going to cover in this edition of the director s cut is going to orbit this seasons of changewith a few seasons under our belt since shadowkeep we re well underway on internal discussions around how we feel about them we look at these iterations through a bunch of lenses first there s the soft smushy how do we feel about seasons these feelings are mined from our own experiences and from ongoing roll-ups of information from our community we also look at how well seasons are engaging our players are people coming back each week how long are they playing what do we look like month-over-month and how does it perform against our historical data then we start to talk about where to take seasons in year looking back there is some good stuff and things we need to work on let s start with what s been working well our seasonal narratives are starting to connect to one another the transition to season with the community getting involved by donating fractaline in -count stacks accompanied by looooooooooong button holds big shout out to the top fractaline donors in the world jlowes dathan warbucks and joshd and lighting the lighthouse was a neat start at players working to move the world forward ensuring that each story link in the seasonal chain connects to the next and sets up where we re heading the save a legend element of season of dawn was a nice deep cut for those who have been with destiny since the beginning and a way to introduce the-ultimate-titan-as-pigeon-superfan-slash-guardian-orinthologist to many people who hadn t found his grave the first time seeing your reactions was a highlight and the team had a lot of fun building this one i ve enjoyed the simplicity of leveling up destiny s version of a battle pass we wanted a progression that you could advance just by playing the game we don t think we ve got the whole xp thing figured out running in and out of lost sectors and flash-farming xp isn t what we had in mind but we can keep tuning it speaking strictly about my own play patterns i feel the need each season to get all of the pass universal ornaments and the title i like knowing those cosmetics are unique and won t be offered again however i find myself personally less motivated to try and get awesome rolls for the new weapons which is especially strange considering i like having a nice version of each gun in destiny wanna do some weapon stuff now there s gonna be more weapon stuff later on but let s just chum the waters a little bit interlude i still really like playing this game i ve acquired almost every weapon in the game whyyyyyyy anarchyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy i have some pretty slick rolls on a few of them and near-miss internet-approved god rolls on others spare rations rapid kill clip and then full bore and a quick visit to disappointown with alloy magazine like many of you i end up gravitating to a few weapons and just using them instead of everything else sure the outlaw multikill clip breachlight i farmed from season of dawn is nice to have and i love the art for the dawn weapon set but is it really going to displace my go-to pve kinetic weapons probably not i know that i recently sat with a couple of external folks who really love breakneck it s the only thing they use they aren t ever going to use another primary weapon in destiny why because they don t need to part of aspiration is the pursuit that comes with it and right now the way we are and have been treating weapons in destiny isn t actually fueling the aspiration engine back to seasons end interlude on the other hand we aren t delivering the feeling of an evolving world instead we are delivering the feeling of ephemeral private activities and rewards that go away the forsaken annual pass had its share of challenges see last year s dc but it also had this awesome property if i stopped playing for a season when i came back there were a bunch of rewards and activities that i could catch up on what we re discussing now and which is early enough that things might still change is how we focus our efforts around seasons from a development standpoint while also trying to create the moments that make memories while also balancing the amount of fear of missing out this is a tricky balance because these elements don t connect neatly and in many cases they work against one another the wall of text below is how we re thinking about things at the moment we re going to be continuing to take in the feedback our guts and data provides your reactions and feedback are a part of that data so do continue to let us know your thoughts on our seasonal model before we get into some more thoughts and details i want to be extremely clear this year s version of seasons has too much fomo in them we want to fix this and next year s seasons will have less because we aren t spending our development resources and time as well as we could we re talking about moving away from creating season-bespoke private activities and instead using that time and effort to build themes that aren t just represented by a marquee event that will fade away but rather to inject these seasonal themes into more of the game like we continue to evolve the world s narrative we could invest more in the evolving world of our public spaces and take further efforts to evolve destiny s core activities core activities what are those core activities are a way we think about a player s options and motivations in a given evening of destiny they are meant to be more evergreen quest campaign content for instance is not generally evergreen it s usually something matchmade and designed with replayability in mind either from the properties of the activity itself or the rewards for example crucible is fundamentally replayable because the opponents can be different and other players are the ultimate a i where the ordeal is fundamentally replayable because of its reward structure rather than random encounter generation in fact we hope the ordeal is consistent within a given week to create mastery and efficiency in defeating it ideally core activities are convergence points for player motivations e g i want to maximize xp chase awesome items and generate economy that i can use to further my goals yes i know no one talks this way right now our seasonal activities like sundial compete with the core activities they have new rewards and award players powerful gear but they don t provide a bunch of xp core activities provide a bunch of xp but we all feel the pain of how many more seasons will i get the titan rain-catching shoulder pads from the drifter what this competition means is that it can be really hard to line up a night of optimizing in destiny because you re being pulled in different directions by our design so what could investing more in core activities look like it could mean more rewards being distributed into these activities or it could mean taking a theme for a season and using it to galvanize strikes if we re going to ask players to engage with these activities we have an opportunity to leverage rewards throughout the season imagine the armor sets or sundial weapons being woven into core activity reward pools or imagine experiences like pursuing rolls for sweet weapons that could only be found in a given playlist as an end-of-match reward like a crucible eyasluna we also think we could invest more of our development time on our questlines right now things like sundial consume team resources and then fade away imagine instead that seasonal questlines like save a legend didn t go away in the following season but instead existed until the next expansion releases that way as players drift in an out of the game there s a bunch of content building up for them to play when they return just as we continue to evolve the narrative of our world we can continue to invest in evolving the world of open world public spaces in case you re unfamiliar these are the spaces where you seamlessly see other players appear we ve built a world where players can encounter others but we haven t made a world with fights challenging enough where you feel like other players matter weapons forever the problem ok let s talk more about weapons and let s begin with how weapons have worked in destiny all the way back to destiny vanilla every weapon you get is a weapon you can keep and infuse to raise its power level indefinitely remember the waters i talked about chumming earlier it s time to eat in destiny with infusion it s like having every card you own in magic available and playable in all formats forever it passively creates power creep an ongoing destiny problem which also means our teams need to spend more and more of their time re-testing and supporting old stuff instead of making new stuff it reduces player desire for new items which dismantles aspiration like the shard-the-blues post-crucible match ritual and it means we ultimately create a ton of gear that doesn t have any value beyond ticking the box on the i got it checklist that isn t value it s actually the opposite of value because it s work that we could be putting into making new stuff or improving old stuff our combat team works extremely hard to make weapons feel unique each legendary and many blues get their own flavors of special sauce sometimes it s the way a gun sounds sometimes it s the insanely over budget range stat hand in hand sometimes it s the recoil pattern sometimes it s the art sometimes it s something indescribable that just makes an item resonate with our players in an action game like destiny our weapons are feel-based extensions to the character i ve played mmos and arpgs where i get amazing weapons but rarely have those weapons felt like an extension of my avatar certainly in an action game like dark souls or sekiro the weapons become a feel-based extension of my character rather than a stat stick like fang of korialstrasz remember many many words ago in previous dcs when i talked about the collision between the action game and the rpg couple with that with our theme of aspiration and i believe we are approaching an inflection point for weapons and infusion in destiny we ve made a lot of magic cards and we want you to keep the ones you love in your collection as opposed to taking them and throwing them all away and having the tower get destroyed again and a bunch of those magic cards could be playable around the world while free-roaming or in pvp formats but where power matters or aspirational activities are involved we re going to make some changes to legendary weapons there was a lot of learning to do when destiny launched in but there was also some real good stuff in that game i think back on a bunch of it fondly almost wistfully at times the weapons from the vault of glass could be powerful unique and rare if you had fatebringer you probably had a bunch of ascendant shards to commemorate all of the times you didn t get it i miss those days when rewards were rarer and so special that you celebrated or hated when your friends got one that s in part because the design of the game gave them space to be different space to be awesome it s hard to cleave out that space in the current version of destiny weapons that are supposed to come from pinnacle activities like raids or trials don t really have space to breathe the answer can t be just make them better because that approach ends up with the reckoning situation i described last year now we had pinnacle weapons which were largely just talents that had exotic-esque capabilities in legendary-clothing these weapons were typically the result of long pursuits and when they arrived in your hands they were pretty strong sometimes hilariously strong looking at you recluse it also meant the team spent significant time developing each one if you imagine the abstract weapon space as a pyramid those pinnacle weapons largely sat at the top of the pyramid most other legendary weapons are down in a clump of they aren t really that different why because when every legendary item the team builds is going to be around forever outliers get weeded out back to the vault of glass weapons could be memorable because we knew they weren t going to be in the ecosystem for things like trials nightfalls and raids forever they d naturally fall by the wayside because power attack light in those days would make them obsolete in the world we re imagining we ll have space at the top end to create powerful legendary weapons legendaries that are just better than other items in the classification we ll be able to do that because the design space for weapons will expand and contract over time items will enter the ecosystem be able to be infused for some number of seasons and beyond that their power won t be able to be raised our hope is that instead of having to account for a weapon s viability forever when we create one it can be easier to let something powerful exist in the ecosystem and those potent weapons entering the ecosystem mean there s more fun items to pursue changes like this also mean legendary weapons or their talents that would be shelved could be reissued at a future date or could be brought back in fun ways by involving our community the more specific nitty gritty for this will come a little bit further down the road but we wanted to get some of thinking behind it to you sooner rather than later the simplest version of how it is going to work is legendary weapons will have fixed values for how high they can be infused those values will project the weapon s viable-in-end-game lifespan and we think that lifespan is somewhere between and months one final note we are not applying this to exotic weapons at this time we want to iterate on the legendary ecosystem first cosmic gardenerslast year we said we want playing destiny to feel like you're playing in a game world with true momentum a universe that is going somewhere a game where things are happening not just in terms of new items and activities but also in terms of narrative it s frequently seemed like destiny was treading water in terms of moving the world s narrative forward we want to tackle this in destiny s third year that statement is still true for us today as we look into d y and beyond we started this in year but the job isn t done by its very nature this is something that really doesn t have an end the idea of building a narrative that is moving the story of your guardians plural all of you forward creating a universe where permanent change is possible and where players can have meaningful impact is still a thing we re chasing and experimenting with to get there change is going to be inevitable see above where i talked about how we re thinking about adjusting the seasonal model we ve said before that destiny cannot keep growing indefinitely there are lots of reasons why this is true some technical and some creative because the story wants to push into new areas on the technical side i come back to sustainability as new areas features and event types are added to destiny the problems of maintenance grow accordingly for the team new changes to the system have to be checked against all content new and old alike that introduces risk and a big burden on our teams to maintain that legacy content in practical terms it also prevents us from responding to players who have problems as quickly as we would like seasons can do some of the heavy lifting here in the sense of giving players a sense of shared purpose and understanding of what they re working for but when we ready expansions it s a chance to make some more fundamental changes to the game world and its systems we ve done significant systems changes to all destiny games every time we ve shipped an expansion and now we re going to be making more changes to the game world as we go forward we re getting towards the end here but before we wrap here s a few quick hits on some important topics shortcut faction rallieslots of folks have been wondering if faction rallies will return we have no plans to bring back faction rallies the reward gear hasn t been used that much our character cast is growing too large and crucially they didn t drive a bunch of engagement with the game that said there s some sweet looks in that gear and we re moving the faction rally armor to the legendary engram reward pools in season alongside a few popular faction weapons shortcut bright engrams for season we re doing away with bright engrams as purchasable items we want players to know what something costs before they buy it bright engrams don t live up to that principle so we will no longer be selling them on the eververse store though they will still appear on the free track of the season pass shortcut new light new introour goals for new light last year were about bringing new players into the universe and getting them to the core activities as quickly as we could we dramatically underestimated how many new guardians would wake up on the cosmodrome we re going to improve the new light entry this fall and flesh the starting experience in destiny out shortcut questlogthere s another round of changes coming out with season for the quest tab the number of quests you have at any given time sure can feel daunting especially for procrastinators so we re adding a new feature to the quest tab categorization all quests are automatically assigned a category and this buckets them into a specific area within the quest tab for example exotic quests get their own category as well as seasonal quests the seasonal quest category is helpful in that it contains all of the quests that expire at the end of the season there are several categories including one for older releases e g forsaken quests this should help players focus on the quests that are new and most relevant vs older content that maybe isn t as high-priority as it used to be exit musicthanks for being here i appreciate that you re invested in the game enough or excited enough about trolling to sift through the text above we re early into and we ve got some cool stuff planned shortly season is entering orbit and there will be more to talk about as the calendar continues a lot of work from a lot of folks goes into each time i or

leading up to season of redacted let s get to it taking a pass this week we re putting the magnifying glass on weapons while swords were given a bit of an overhaul in functionality other weapon archetypes are seeing some finer tuning damage values ranges and even reload canceling are on the table this time around we know one of the first questions on your mind will be is this a crucible-centric update or will pve get changes this season as well while the following changes will be coming out at the beginning of season of redacted some are in preparation for a new pve challenge coming later in the season a new nightfall difficulty officially dubbed grandmaster will test even the most proficient guardians we ll have more details about this new ordeal in the coming weeks but for now we have information from the dev team on changes being made to ensure that we strike the right balance between challenge and reward dev team for season of redacted we ve adjusted quite a few weapon archetypes alongside the changes to swords that were announced two weeks ago while these are not all the changes in the release we re covering some important conversation pieces here izanagi s burdensince the removal of auto-reload effects from rally barricade and lunafaction boots as well as the introduction of a catalyst for izanagi s burden it s seen a significant uptick in use izanagi s burden solidified itself within the majority of endgame builds due to its excellent burst damage sustained damage ammo economy due to special ammo and safety due to being a sniper rifle the outlaw trait was swapped out for no distractions to be more in-line with the fantasy of the weapon and to ensure the trait on the weapon would still work with honed edge the animation speed of honed edge is no longer affected by the reload statoutlaw has been replaced with no distractionssniper rifleswe gave sniper rifles an increase in pve damage back in shadowkeep we re removing that change for a few reasons sniper rifles have a lot of utility and safety due to their range and the increased damage was giving them too much of a leg-up on their closer range counterparts that gulf only widens as the difficulty of any given encounter goes up the direct changes to adaptive and rapid-fire snipers were to make the differences in the sub-archetypes more impactful again as well as to give some amount of parity with the adjustments to shotguns and fusion rifles damage to major enemies and above have been reduced to pre shadowkeep values - adaptive snipers precision multiplier has been reduced from x to x rapid-fire snipers base impact has been reduced from damage to damage grenade launchersthrough a combination of archetype adjustments and new perks being introduced grenade launchers have been quite powerful ever since season of the drifter we ve changed the aggressive frame sub-archetype to the rapid-fire sub-archetype to be more in line with other weapon s established conventions and slightly reduced their effectiveness on powerful enemies to give other weapons some more breathing room aggressive frame grenade launchers are now rapid-fire frame grenade launchers rapid-fire frame grenade launchers have had their damage reduced to account for their rate of fire x but now also have increased reserves previously aggressive frame grenade launchers fired faster than adaptive but had the same damage damage to major enemies and above by power weapon grenade launchers reduced by lord of wolvesthe ease of use granted by changes to release the wolves made it very difficult to approach and made the margin of error extremely large we ve pushed the two states apart via accuracy to ensure that the default state is the norm rather than the exception with this change release the wolves should be used at extremely close ranges against large targets instead of just being a better version of the default behavior release the wolves now significantly reduces this weapon s accuracy while active the last wordwhen reintroduced in season of the forge the last word became quite dominant due to its extremely forgiving maximum time-to-kill ttk we re adjusting the way the weapon works to focus it back as a hip-fire based weapon while also improving that side of the experience for both controller and mouse and keyboard inputs we also made it a little less forgiving so that you still have to concentrate on your aim while wielding the weapon fan fire now adjusts the precision scalar while hip-firing fan fire impact values have been adjusted precision hip ads adjusted from to non-precision hip ads adjusted from to aiming down sights no longer provides additional effective range damage falloff reduced stability for mouse and keyboard input reduced the effective range to improve the experience adjusted the way target acquisition is handled while hip-firing shotgunsone issue we ve been waiting to fix before adjusting shotguns again was an oddity in the way our aim assist system works with weapons that don t care much about precision damage as an example for shotguns at certain distances between players the aim assist system would prioritize the head causing the entire spread to deviate from center mass and make the player miss out on the kill with that issue out of the way we made more adjustments to shotguns to give other weapons a little more time to react to them target acquisition for non-slug shotguns has been adjusted to no longer account for precision locations previously target acquisition could actually cause the player's spread to deviate from the intended aim vector causing most of the spread to miss cone angle is now adjusted on a per sub-archetype basis and is no longer adjusted by the range stat aiming down sights no longer adjusts effective range for this weapon archetype fusion riflessimilar to the issue noted above with shotguns fusion rifles also suffered from some target acquisition related oddities that we ve since fixed most of the changes here are adjustments focusing on the high impact sub-archetype backup plan was an exotic perk in the original destiny release and it was placed on legendary fusion rifles in destiny due to them being heavy ammo weapons at the time rather than the special ammo weapons they currently are when weapons were shuffled around in forsaken the perk came along with them and we ve decided to adjust it alongside the archetype itself to have it fall back in line with other legendary perks target acquisition for fusion rifles has been adjusted to no longer account for precision locations previously target acquisition could actually cause the player's volley to deviate from the intended aim vector causing most of the volley to miss damage falloff for this weapon archetype can now floor at x previously x effective range and the impact of the optics stat for this weapon archetype has been reduced across the board backup planbackup plan now adjusts impact to match the rapid-fire sub-archetype while active charge time is now set to match the rapid-fire's sub-archetype while active auto riflessome small tweaks have been made to give auto rifles a small boost in efficacy for the crucible though they also influence pve the nature of the way destiny is played tends to have semi-auto based weaponry be more effective in general and so we re compensating for that with these tweaks these are fairly modest changes intended to give auto rifles more of a chance in an open fight without attempting to drag the ttk of the entire game down the following impact values have changed precision frame default precision previously adaptive frame default precision previously rapid-fire frame default precision previously these are some of the biggest changes coming to weapons but be sure to check out the official patch notes in early march for the full list we ll also have a preview of exotic armor changes along with tuning to your supers and abilities in

       " Document(page_content='earlier today tuesday february th after the launch of hotfix we were made aware of the re-emergence of an issue which caused a small percentage of players to lose currency and materials this comes after the first incidence of this issue which caused all players to lose currency and materials on january th with the launch of hotfix and resulted in player account rollbacks with today s incident we have taken similar steps and rolled back accounts to the state they were in as of am pst before the launch of since both of these incidents are identical in cause and the effect on our players and because both incidents happened within a close window of time we wanted to give you a picture of what went wrong how we fixed it and how we re planning on making sure this doesn t happen again in the future first let s look at what caused this problem in the first place a game bug involving inventory management and a series of server configurations that re-introduced the bug after it was fixed inventory managementin destiny quests are treated similar to other inventory items such as currency and materials all items have a timestamp based on when they were first added to a player s inventory this timestamp is used to sort quests in the order in which they were acquired the game cleans up a player s inventory upon each login to make sure it is consistent with any changes to content such as the maximum number of items of a particular type the player can carry several months ago players reported that quest log sorting wasn t working properly and we wanted to fix that the team investigated and found that the clean-up process was resetting the timestamp on a subset of quests which was breaking chronological sorting we decided to fix this by disabling the timestamp-resetting behavior for quests that fix was conceptually reasonable but through subtle side effects it ended up disabling too much of the clean-up process the net result was that the game calculated the wrong cap quantity for stacked items such as currencies and materials which caused items above the cap to be lost we knew this code was critical and per our typical process we had two domain experts provide code reviews for the change but sadly we didn t spot the bug a few days later our internal test teams caught this issue however we incorrectly concluded that it was caused by a tooling failure with debug workflows we use for testing and not an actual bug within the game having dodged all our diligence the issue went live in once the bug was identified in the live game the next step was to figure out how to fix it which leads us to the next discussion game servers and their configurations server configurationsbefore every major release for example shadowkeep we do comprehensive stress testing to try and model user behavior and its impact on our service architecture because there s no substitute for millions of real player behaviors we supplement this testing by closely monitoring service metrics after launch back in october in order to handle increased cpu and player load for shadowkeep s launch we spun up additional servers in this case called worldservers more servers in fact than we have ever used before for this task running with this many servers has had some small side effects that we were tracking but were generally invisible to players for example one issue was that a small percentage less than percent of these servers would crash on start-up due to the volume of servers overwhelming one of the backing databases our workaround for this was to simply manually restart the crashed servers each time we detected this issue and this appeared to address the problem without any discernable side effects for players fast-forward to two weeks ago the update had the aforementioned bug that caused character data corruption and resulted in our first ever rollback of character data to fix that issue quickly we applied a patch to the servers instead of trying to get a full build of the game code deployed this involved making a change to a server setting to override the game code used to process character data and then restarting the worldservers to pick up that change fast forward again to today february th when we rolled out the update coinciding with the launch of crimson days after launch some of the worldservers once again crashed on startup because of a high volume of servers starting simultaneously once again we manually restarted those servers and thought everything was fine we were wrong unbeknownst to us this crash resulted in those worldservers not applying the previous character data corruption fix this meant that a small percentage of worldservers were running the old code and the bug that was corrupting character data we have verification systems that detect these sorts of version misconfigurations but the worldserver crashes and subsequent manual restarts caused the servers to also skip the verification process prior to this morning we had believed skipping these overrides and verifications to be impossible as a part of our standard practices of verifying a new build we also have our test teams log in with a number of test accounts in order to verify the player experience because we have hundreds of servers in our retail environment every manual test we performed was un lucky enough to hit the good servers and all of them missed the small percentage of servers that were in a bad state so we gave the all clear today as the game came back on after the deployment we started seeing player reports of lost currency the team began investigating immediately and took the game down at am pst in that time hundreds of thousands of unique players had logged into the game or accessed their characters through a third party service our investigation uncovered what we thought was an impossible situation a small number of our worldservers had loaded without the correct configuration which fixed the corruption issues from unfortunately anyone whose characters had been accessed using one of these out-of-date servers encountered the character-corrupting problem once we determined this was the same issue that occurred on january th and we understood how it happened the team decided that our best path forward rather than trying to identify each affected account and risk missing something in the process was to restore all character data from the backup that took place just before the patch rolled out preventive measuresthe team has identified a number of additional safeguards that should prevent this particular issue from happening in the future we have added further safeguards to our process for hot-patching our servers to ensure that they cannot start with an unexpected version this change is in place as we spin up the game today we have fixed the issue that caused a small fraction of worldservers to crash on startup this fix will be deployed with season the permanent fix for character corruption will be rolled into the next update as an executable change removing the need for the configuration override unfortunately the hotfix was too far along to benefit from this looking ahead we are investigating ways to speed up our rollback and recovery mechanisms in a future release we will address the issue that can cause servers to skip loading configuration data we will also add more protections to the login-account clean-up code to help prevent future bugs from being introduced into such a critical area we are updating our development methodologies to catch issues like this earlier in the release pipeline with today s rollback all character accounts will now be in the state they were at around am pst the team is also hard at work in preparing hotfix with a planned release on february th also of note this hotfix will include a fix for the infinite dawnblade issue we know today s outage and character rollback has been frustrating for you especially with the launch of crimson days just as it s been frustrating for us to realize that this is a problem we should have been able to avoid we re sorry for the frustration

others will bear more of a pve focus our first subject swords some are sharp some are blunt one lets you bend space and time to teleport through enemies another has projectiles that can take down foes at range since the launch of destiny we ve been seeing feedback on general functionality and the team has been kicking around ideas on how to make things a bit more enticing after some brainstorming and development time swords are receiving a sort of tableflip when it comes to light attacks heavy attacks and guarding while you ll still rip and tear through opponents as you would expect from a sword most of what you know needs to be unlearned the blades have been rebalanced and a new energy meter is making its way to swords below you ll find a full rundown from our development team dev team swords are getting a little more love this season while swords have been a staple of destiny ever since their introduction in the taken king we felt they were due for an update both to freshen them up but also to allow us more room to work with them in later releases sword energyswords now have their own reserve of energy that recharges naturally on its own and is not to be confused with ammo capacity this energy will overtake your melee slot while you re wielding a sword and is spent on various actions guardingguarding now uses sword energy instead of consuming ammo different guards have different consumption rates damage resistance and behaviors so be sure to experiment and find a guard type you like you ll still need at least one ammo to begin guarding though back during season of the drifter the stronghold exotic for titans was introduced allowing them to guard with relative impunity and opening up a more interesting opportunities for swords to shine in a variety of content which caused us to take another look at the guard function itself although the guard function has always existed it was never really considered worth the cost with this change we hope that players will use their guard intelligently to protect themselves instead of it being an almost unused button rest easy stronghold has also been modified to still allow titans a unique guarding experience light attacksgrounded light attacks for all swords will now loop for an infinite combo and all swords can cleave while the basic three hit combo is quite a staple of melee weapons in many games in a shooter this leaves the player extremely open to enemies by letting the light attacks loop we also push them and the heavy attacks apart further cleaving on light attacks was previously only on the aggressive swords but we opted to add it to the rest of them for more hack n slash heavy attacksheavy attacks now consume sword energy while you are always able to perform a heavy attack the attack is stronger when you have full energy and weaker when you don t a lot of swordplay in many situations simply boiled down to endlessly mashing the heavy attack button instead of mixing up attacks which wasn t quite the most interesting experience do note that aerial heavy attacks as a general rule do not consume sword energy but that can vary based on the sword shield bypassa portion of most sword attacks can partially bypass elemental shields we added this to give swords a little bit of a personality difference from shotguns who share a very similar role in combat as powerful cqc weapons in general swords have also had some of the damage amounts for different attacks changed and the various sword perks have been adjusted so you ll want to experiment a bit after the changes hit we do hope

on tuesday january the player support team began noticing a trend of topics where users had lost various destiny currencies and infusion materials after verifying this issue it was decided by several bungie teams to take the game down in an attempt to prevent more players from being affected due to this issue affecting all accounts and with no way to determine how much each account lost in a timely manner it was decided to roll back everyone s account from our last account backup around am pst due to the rollback any progress or quest that completed between and am pst would have to be redone any item gained during that timeframe would have to be earned again purchases made during that timeframe would have to be redone and silver spent would be restored platform store-purchased

       " Document(page_content=\"this week at bungie the path was found the corridors of time have been charted guardians from around the world took on the monumental challenge of navigating time itself some losing their minds in the process we d never shipped a puzzle of this size before and watching the community engagement was a thrill in itself we ve seen a few requests for commentary on the creation and development of this puzzle as always we re happy to invite you behind the scenes and share some of the thinking that goes into the experiences you play destiny dev team over the past week we ve watched in awe as the community came together to solve one of destiny s most complex puzzles to date everyone who took the time to participate in the solution will be remembered for years to come whether you submitted a screenshot transcribed puzzle pieces generated maps wrote code worked the data or cat-wrangled this monumental team effort please take a moment to congratulate yourselves your efforts and accomplishments were truly inspiring watching the first players solve the puzzle in the early hours of monday morning was a career highlight for many of us on the development team with the puzzle solved and the corridors of time closing next week we wanted to take a moment to talk about our goals and early designs for this puzzle when we started planning the puzzle we created a few goals to guide our development create a time maze through which any player can dive to discover secrets and loreserve as a shared community puzzle that rewards the exotic fusion riflecelebrate community achievement and invite all players to partake in the rewardwith these goals in mind we took inspiration from multiple sources in creating the early designs for the puzzle the bones originated several years ago with the discovery of the sleeper simulant and the ensuing quest to unlock it at the time we recognized that the moment of discovery was reserved for the few people that happened to be online at the time when that hidden content unlocked similarly the secret missions for the whisper and zero hour were also moments of discovery reserved for the few people online within a limited time window to experience first by contrast this puzzle was meant to be experienced by everybody who wanted to be included as is tradition at bungie during our annual studio pentathlon which was held last friday many of us spend the entire day solving puzzles crafted by some of our brightest minds this always culminates in a meta-puzzle that cannot be solved without the contribution of all of the smaller solutions similarly the corridors of time puzzle was designed from the start to be very simple in nature but also require that all of the little bits come together in harmony before revealing its solution the delivery of this puzzle came together as the team began exploring the concept and narrative for season of dawn the puzzle seemed to fit well with the idea of the corridors of time with players meandering and weaving through time to find a very specific reality the early ideas for this space were roughly based on the idea of the cult-classic movie cube where you would leave one door and end up in another identical room with a new death trap waiting for you as always our artists delivered a mind-bending and stunning visual language that simply brought the whole experience together into something that inspires the imagination much like other classic movies such as alice in wonderland or the matrix this space and the way it was connected together was done so to invoke questions like just how deep does this rabbit hole go can you just keep going on forever and is there even an end to this again we want to thank everyone who participated in this puzzle or cheered from the sidelines we re actively monitoring and collecting your feedback from the puzzle itself to the rewards contained to inform how we build experiences like this again in the future now we look ahead we ve got a rundown of performance issues that are currently under investigation and another patch note preview for next week's update performance passover the last few months we ve been gathering feedback associated with game performance this translates to moments when you may see framerate drops during activities or long load times when accessing a menu the team has been deep in the code looking for potential causes of these issues next week we ll have a few performance issues addressed in destiny update including improved some performance issues in the chamber of suffering encounter fixed an issue where players could die when transitioning from the necropolis encounter to the tunnels of despair improved a performance issue that could occur when chunks of land return or are removed during the sanctified mind encounter improved performance when receiving certain investment related messages this could be reward acquisition placing tributes or interacting with obelisks the largest impact will be in the tower but this should help everywhere players who load into crucible matches faster than their peers will no longer be put in black screen rather they will remain in spaceflight until all players have loaded into the match as before some proposed fixes are currently in development for the below items these need to pass through rigorous testing before they ll find their way to a future edition of patch notes ui stuttering and framerate drops when loading or applying modsframerate issues in gambit and gambit primeframerate issues during the sanctified mind encounter of the garden of salvation raidframerate issues in the pit of heresy dungeon specifically in tunnel encountersgeneral improvements to

look to how we support destiny on our own as an evolving world today we d like to talk about some of what we ve heard from you about season of the undying and outline how your feedback is going to impact season of dawn silver-only contentoffering some amount of eververse content for silver only is part of ensuring we are able to fund our ability to keep creating and maintaining destiny and supporting the team that makes destiny that said we agree with you that we d also like to see a higher ratio of items that will also be available for bright dust by the end of season of the undying around of eververse content will have been offered for bright dust in season of dawn we re going to make around of eververse content available for bright dust at some point during the season we ve also heard you say that you want to know what will be offered for silver only so you can plan what you are interested in buying we agree that providing transparency is vital to making informed decisions we plan to share on social every week what items will be for silver only during the season as they appear on the eververse store bright dust economyin season of the undying we changed bright dust from a pay-and or-play-to-earn currency to a play-to-earn reward we want all players to be able to acquire a selection of their favorite eververse content every season just by playing the game and we ve been keeping an eye on the bright dust economy in season of the undying with this in mind in season of dawn all dawning weekly and repeatable bounties will award bright dust in quantities equal to the amount awarded from strike crucible and gambit bounties per weekly and per repeatable crimson days will do the same for weekly bounties only as this event does not include repeatable bounties duplicate purchase preventionthe eververse store no longer permits purchasing an item that is already in your collection hopefully this makes it much more clear which items you have already purchased and will keep you from spending silver or bright dust on an item you already have looking aheadwe re always looking at your feedback and we re going to keep being open with you on how that feedback is woven into our overall goals for destiny and for bungie as we re planning for future seasons we re also thinking about the types and themes of content offered through eververse as well as the role of cosmetic content as a reward for achievement we re committed to continually and thoughtfully adjusting the eververse store to ensure it s a balanced and optional part of the destiny player experience while also ensuring that we can support the team creating and evolving destiny please keep the feedback coming and thanks for all you do to support the team get it before it s goneit s

       " Document(page_content=\"this week at bungie we re investing in solar energy we wrapped up festival of the lost this week but cleaning up the decorations wasn t the only thing that changed in the tower ikora finished her construction project closed out all the permits and guardians launched an attack on the undying mind the attack is ongoing and all season pass holders can join in on vex offensive and transmat the finished portal from the tower to summon and defeat undying minds from different timelines the impact of your victory has not been made clear just yet but in time you will learn more about how this will further evolve the world as we transition into the next season solar shiftsnext season we are shaking up the solar subclasses we are reworking several ability trees and the destiny dev team has the details on what to expect when you praise the sun next season destiny dev team hey guardians it s the combat systems team here back again to talk about some updates we re making to the abilities sandbox in the next season previously we spent a season focusing on subclasses of one specific element type such as arc and void up next the combat systems team is tackling solar subclasses as our focus for gameplay updates as we ve mentioned in past twabs our goal with these subclass updates is to revisit some older subclass paths and freshen them up a bit in execution this means that older subclass paths will feel like viable choices in many of our activities and that players can find a home in any of them when we started working on sandbox updates to follow season of the undying our team looked at the whole catalog of solar subclasses by cross referencing data feedback and conversation to figure out which subclasses needed help which are performing fine and which ones were a bit too potent during our investigations it was pretty clear that three specific subclasses were underperforming and needed to be taken back into the shop for a rework it s worth noting here that a rework doesn t mean it s a completely new subclass it means that we took the root of the gameplay fantasies for those subclasses and either expanded on what was already there or shifted some of the existing attributes closer to their fantasy in some cases entire perks were changed to help further the gameplay role and fantasy of those subclasses those three solar subclasses are gunslinger way of the sharpshooter bottom path traditionally way of the sharpshooter has mostly been used in specific pve activities and almost exclusively paired with the celestial nighthawk helm we wanted to move way of the sharpshooter to be something players want to choose more often and for a wider range of activities to do that we needed to differentiate both golden gun paths and make sharpshooter more versatile and interesting to use in pve in order to differentiate the -shot and -shot golden gun and better play into their fantasies we've made the following changes for -shot we increased the auto-aim distance and reliability when aiming down sights as it fulfills the role of long range accuracy for -shot we shortened the damage falloff range to emphasize the short range gunfighter role with a lot of kill potential while it can still perform at longer ranges it may take an extra shot to get the job done we've made other changes to way of the outlaw to help keep its potency like adding a new explosive prox knife that can stick to surfaces and detonate when enemies pass nearby all up - we want way of the sharpshooter to feel more active and rewarding for players who can fulfill the role of the sharpshooter by taking down enemies with accuracy and precision new weighted knife high-damage knife throw with a long wind up travels at high speeds bounces once and does extra damage to the head precision shot final blows recharge the melee completely one-hit precision final blow in pvp practice makes perfect qol lasts longer but gives a bit less energy per second precision hits grant two stacks new knock 'em down precision final blows increase weapon stability and ads speed timer starts at seconds but any additional final blow assists can increase it up to seconds casting your super with this buff above seconds consumes the buff and grants extra damage does not stack with celestial nighthawk line 'em up qol old perks from crowd pleaser are now part of this perk golden gun can cause precision damage and precision shots generate orbs of light sunbreaker code of the devastator middle path titans who adhere to the code of the devastator want nothing more than to crush their foes with smoldering hammers and we want to see them live their dreams when our data indicated that this subclass was underperforming in pvp we decided to make a few changes that should enable it to be more competitive the roaring flame perk has received a significant buff to its bonus damage and the buff now lasts longer making it easier to build and retain stacks between encounters the base damage of throwing hammer melee ability has increased it's now very lethal in pvp while you have roaring flames active in addition once you've thrown the hammer and it s lying on the ground you don't have to get quite as close to it to pick it back up finally we tuned the super in a number of ways for starters burning maul now lasts longer giving you more time to use it strategically instead of simply spamming the slam button titans all we want to do is smash right we also increased the height of the heavy-slam explosion so this super should feel much more potent against airborne enemies that's the gist of it but here are more details throwing hammer increased impact damage from to and increased hammer pick-up radius from m to m adjusted hammer throw animations to fit a more damaging attack roaring flames increased damage bonus from per stack to per stack in pvp and increased duration from seconds to seconds burning maul increased duration from seconds to secondslight attack reduced light attack energy cost from to adjusted the animation so that it flows seamlessly into chained light attacks without stopping heavy attack ground slam attack now detonates when it detects enemies above it detonation radius was increased to make landing attacks more consistent increased energy cost from to dawnblade attunement of sky top path with attunement of sky we wanted to push its air superiority gameplay further when we initially released this path its movement capabilities were tuned around the original destiny gameplay experience which was much slower and more deliberate about positioning however over time this movement needed to adapt to the new sandbox we want to give you the gameplay experience that the fantasy begs for a flying angel who can maneuver with grace and destroy its foes below now before we get started i wanted to touch on one thing to accomplish our goals of reworking the air superiority role we needed to differentiate the two daybreak paths from one another as such we reduced the speed at which burst glide accelerates players in daybreak we know this is a controversial change but we wanted to reserve the air superiority gameplay with attunement of sky and the burst glide speed was blurring the lines between both daybreak paths icarus dashes while in daybreak have increased speed and thrust to recapture the burst glide gameplay for those running the air superiority path we hope that while this change is different you still feel as fast as before but with maybe a bit more expression behind that speed the rest of the changes are below new celestial fire melee send a spiral of three explosive solar projectiles heat rises rework consume your grenade to extend glide time and dramatically reduce the in-air accuracy penalties for weapons winged sun rework fire weapons use celestial fire and throw grenade while gliding airborne final blows grant melee energy and extend the duration of heat rises icarus dash rework tap crouch twice to dodge in midair dodging in daybreak accelerates players farther and costs less super energy while under the effects of heat rises added note due to the nature of these reworks wings of sacred dawn received a buff where it gains damage resistance while tome of dawn is active there are a whole swath of changes we re working on that extend beyond these three subclasses most solar subclasses had some tuning and some non-solar subclasses got a bit qol love too we hope that with these changes you ll feel energized playing any solar subclass regardless of activity thanks for having us final howl next week lord saladin will return to the tower for the final time during season of undying this will be your final shot at earning pinnacle

balanceover the last year we ve made various changes to the sandbox of destiny some weapons have been brought down some armor has been brought up and the meta has shifted from class to class coming next season the sandbox will evolve once more this week we ll be looking at two notorious items that you may have heard about from the development team the reclusechanged the effects of master of arms removed the precision damage modifierrecluse will continue to receive a damage bonus from master of arms but damage will not default to precision values when the perk activatesmany doubted the recluse when it was first announced but it has since proved to be resilient to being squashed although the precision damage modifier did not actually improve the efficacy of the weapon at its best it did allow for fairly mindless spraying to be just as good as concentrated aiming after considering various options on what to do with it the decision was made to remove that part of the functionality and preserve its activation methods the alternative was leaving in an effect we believe to be too strong for a legendary weapon one-eyed maskchanged the effects of vengeanceremoved the overshield granted from defeating an opponent that inflicted damage on youin a previous sandbox update one-eyed mask received some tuning in how vengeance was applied to titans next season this perk will continue to provide health regeneration when defeating an opponent that has inflicted damage upon your guardian but it will no longer grant an overshield additionally the team is addressing some feedback concerning the newly released xenophage exotic xenophageincreased pve damage by ammo pulled from pvp crates has been increased to from from shared and solo heavy ammo crates respectivelyxenophage unintentionally shipped a little weak so it s getting a bump up in raw damage machine guns have a higher ammunition capacity than other heavy weapons trading raw dps for ease of use xenophage slides further towards other heavy weapons such as grenade launchers in that aspect but didn t get enough power back this will correct that in the next few weeks we ll have further sandbox patch note

shattering strike after performing a flawless execution your melee attacks have a longer lunge range and weaken enemiesadvanced warning when we made the change to flawless execution this also unintentionally nerfed this ability to only last seconds it was directly tied to the truesight we have prepared a fix for the patch to restore the weaken and lunge range increase to last the entire seconds regardless of truesight and invisibility status instant reloadinggoal in the beginning lunafactions and rally barricade did exist but they were clunky to use they still had dramatic impact on gameplay even in that state but eventually we decided to make their effects easier to handle the problems they introduced always existed in the game but over time these have become magnified due to new abilities perks and weapons introduced into the destiny sandbox the impact of something that takes all reloading out of the equation means that other perks or effects like the hunter s marksman dodge or the sealed ahamkara s grasps can simply fall to the wayside even swords take a hit in comparison being one of the few weapons that naturally never needs to reload reloading is one of those mechanics that are simple but have wide ranging consequences because the effect on gameplay of removing reloading is inversely proportional to the size of your weapon s magazine and how slow your general reload animations are weapons like rocket launchers and shotguns can benefit greatly compared to other weapons this alongside the increase in general access to damage bonus effects like well of radiance left us with the decision to remove this effect from these two sources as they were causing things to quickly snowball out of control titan rally barricadethis ability now provides a large increase to reload speed for the duration of the effectthis ability no longer automatically reloads your weapons from reserveswarlock rift well of radiancelunafaction boots now provides a large increase to reload speed for the duration of well of radiancethis exotic no longer automatically reloads your weapons from reservessuper energy regenerationgoal these changes will reduce the speed with which players are able to earn their super which supports difficulty and reduces the current ability to trivialize certain content through excessively chaining supers systemically we want to reduce base sources of supers on a large macro scale without diminishing the feeling that your actions are gaining you a worthwhile energy boost by reducing the speed at which you gain super we can make mods and perks feel more worthwhile we still want it to feel like you can make meaningful progress not only through normal play but by augmenting super energy through teamwork class choices gear and skillful play new energy granted by super orbs super orb reduction masterwork orb reduction kills reduction minor elite mini-boss boss player assists reduction minor elite mini-boss boss player damage multipliersgoal at destiny launch damage buffs were fairly sparse there was empowering rift for a small increase and you could combine it with a weakening effect such as hammer strike but very little else as time has gone on we introduced well of radiance weapons of light guiding flame frontal assault etc and combining these effects has resulted in player damage output far beyond what was previously available even with just a small amount of them a player can go from x damage to x and beyond causing there to be an extremely large gap between standard player output and theoretical output by preventing the larger effects from stacking we are able to keep each of them around without having to do something in response like raise boss health to compensate for these tactics as well as create more of them as an example lumina would not have been created in world where the damage bonus effect of noble rounds stacked with other damage effects and these changes are simply an extension along those same lines while the weakening effects never stacked we also took a look at them and adjusted their values as many of our more powerful units would simply evaporate when touched by one of them but we compensated for that in other ways such as either extending the duration of the effect or in the case of shadowshot making it affect power weapons player damage buffsplayer bonusesbonus damage effects that apply to all of a player's weapons simultaneously no longer stack multiplicatively the highest applicable bonus will be used insteadthis does not affect single weapon buffs such as rampage kill clip or exotic weapons that increase their own damage these will still stack multiplicatively buffs that provide bonus damage will still exist simultaneously on the player so in the event that the one with the highest multiplier wears off the next highest will be used instead this change affects the following weapons abilities empowering rift frontal assault guiding flame sun warrior inertia override well of radiance lumina noble rounds weapons of light notable exceptions vengeance one eyed mask frontal assaultbonus damage is now previously sun warriorbonus

especially roaming supers while we believe supers should be powerful they should not be mindless we want supers to be more risky in both pve and pvp we want players to think about positioning and timing more not so long ago we experimented with spectral blades by lowering the damage resistance substantially these changes were generally well received and improved the experience of the super for both the person running it and the person who was running from it in pve players shouldn t feel like their super makes them invulnerable and casting one should call for situational strategic thinking in pvp players need to feel like they can challenge a super and that with skillful play there s a chance they can beat it super damage resistance removed from masterwork armorinherent super damage

weapons will become ritual weapons they will no longer have special perks and will instead be curated rolls a previous article incorrectly showed two new pinnacle weapons the good news is you will be getting three ritual weapons for each of the ritual activities crucible vanguard and gambit here s the destiny dev team on why we made this difficult decision and some information on upcoming perk changes destiny dev team the decision to stop creating extremely powerful pinnacle weapons was made for a variety of reasons the first was that the band in which pinnacle perk can exist is actually quite small and most of them far exceeded the efficacy they should have been at another issue is that they cause problems in the player ecosystem particularly in the case of the crucible pinnacle weapons due to the nature of pvp and pve anything that works well in pvp is likely going be extremely effective in pve as well this forces players into the crucible if they want the best loadouts even the title of pinnacle set a variety of unrealistic expectations rather than being the absolute height of legendary power they were supposed to be interesting novelties to chase these problems became more pronounced the more of them we produced in the end we decided to move away from pinnacle weapons if you managed to collect them all we hope you enjoy them while we re on the subject of weapons here are a few important notes on changes to how perks will work reduced the effectiveness of the following perks in pve rampage kill clip swashbuckler multikill clip desperado surrounded master of arms onslaughtin general these perks use the same damage multipliers for pve that they did in pvpthe change to rampage does not affect the huckleberryonslaught and desperado now change bullet impact values while active in pvesurrounded no longer multiplies precision damage on top of base damage as it was benefiting some weapon types more than others as a resultlegendary weapons have become too powerful overall in many cases they even outclass exotic primary weapons so we re walking them all back a bit all the way back in original destiny we had a perk named crowd control which was rampage s predecessor crowd control capped out at a bonus of extra damage at this point in destiny rampage caps out at about that s a increase from the original iteration legendary damage perks have become so powerful they simply invalidate non-damage related perks here s a quick preview of the three ritual weapons you can earn in season of the undying because these weapons are no longer pinnacle weapons the quest required to earn them is not as in depth as previous seasons vanguard edgewise crucible randy s throwing knife gambit exit strategy set it straightduring the run up to launch we ve been dropping videos articles interviews and information all over the internets along the way the fact-checkers called us out a few times today we re issuing some corrections to previous transmissions there was a shot of trials of the nine armor in the launch trailer by mistake we wanted to clear up any confusion and let players know that the trials of the nine set will not obtainable in season of the undying we also had to revise our gameplay calendar for season of the undying the menu of action is the same but we are adjusting the timing of the nightmare hunts the new schedule looks like this back when we were first talking about finishers and some of the mods that go with them we talked about how one of the mods enabled you to spawn heavy ammo for your fireteam when you executed a finisher that was still in flux at the time and for balance reasons we ended up making a mod that will spawn heavy ammo for yourself and a mod that will spawn special ammo for your fireteam wear it with prideat bungie our mission is to build worlds the inspire friendship our games become places where people all kinds of people can gather to share meaningful experiences one of the most important aspects of friendship is acceptance earlier this year we took to the streets as part of the seattle pride parade we also offered up a pride pin via the bungie store that was rumored to have an emblem that would come with it the rumors are true and we ve chosen international coming out day as the advent to deploy the in-game expression of acceptance for the details along with a personal story to capture the spirit of that day here is one of our own hi y all my name s nigel you may know me from things like the shattered throne ride along or this wonderful fan video made during our st jude s charity stream this is my first twab post and i m a little nervous so i m going to use one of my favorite tv shows golden girls as a crutch picture it tempe arizona a sophomore in college at this point in my life i d never really had a girlfriend or really found myself attracted to a woman i refused to believe i was gay having seen so many coming-out stories go poorly with family and friends abandoning people they loved i didn t want that for myself so i ignored it by playing video games dragon age origins had just released and my twin brother had been bugging me for a good week to buy it and play it quickly i found myself wrapped in magic and steel for an untold but probably perfectly healthy amount of time during this time i found myself conversing with one of the male party members simply trying to raise his approval that s when it appeared the option to flirt with this character i was as the kids say shooketh i sat for what must have been twenty minutes before deciding to click on it he flirted back my heart skipped i was a ball of nerves and anxiety as the conversation continued with another chance to confess romantic feelings to the character i thought i was going to vomit all over a simple choice in a video game i debated with myself what did it mean that i wanted to flirt with this character why did i suddenly feel like my entire existence would be changed with this one conversation i clicked it and that s when i learned about rejection from a digital character he wasn t gay and my heart sunk but his next words were something i didn t know i needed there s nothing wrong with who you love you are my friend no matter what i spent the next two hours on the floor crying finally feeling that it was okay to be gay i felt more comfortable than i d ever felt in my life i vowed if i ever got the opportunity to pay it forward i would well i m helping to pay it forward i ve spent a lot of my time at bungie helping to make sure destiny is a welcoming place i have marched in the seattle pride parade i have helped set up the trevor foundation and other lgbtiqa charities most recently i helped create those wonderful bungie pride pins you keep seeing on our streams i m happy to announce that on october international coming out day we ll be releasing a pride emblem for your guardian if you ve purchased this pin if you missed the chance to buy the pin back in june mark your calendars because we ll be restocking our supply on the bungie store destiny and bungie are places where we can foster community and work together no matter your background we at

your weapons will be fine-tuned for this pass the team put some love in to a few exotics that may have been collecting dust in your vaults on top of that a bit of tuning has been done in how damage is applied to different targets in pve environments in terms of how these changes will impact your pvp experience a few weapons and archetypes are being buffed with some seeing more aggressive range falloff to give breathing room to scout rifles and other weapons combatants - generalminor enemies rank-and-file no longer take more precision damage than other enemies these enemies previously took twice as much damage to their precision hit locations than enemies of higher ranks you will still deal precision damage but this is now entirely dependent on the weapon as it is for higher ranked enemies weapon changes - generalweapon mods are now treated as reusable unlocks instead of consumables any mods you have in your inventory will be converted to unlocksthis gives players the

thing destiny update recently brought some frequently requested quality of life changes to reckoning and rewards next week we ll be making one additional change to the experience further bridging the gap between you and your desired rewards starting on september all negative modifiers will be removed from reckoning this activity will continue to feature a weekly singe with a daily rotation of brawler grenadier and heavyweight our goal in this change is to improve the replay-ability of reckoning so players will feel more inclined to hop in to matchmaking for some sweet loot this should also

october to claim their purchased silver saw something husky happen on mars imitation is the sincerest form of flattery for some of you destiny old timers husky raids began a trend in content creation staging wonderful music videos on the destinations of destiny they inspired many to dance to their favorite tracks from the methane seas of titan to the rocky outcroppings of io this week our runner up is an homage and we loved every second of it our selection for movie of the week just barely edged a win thanks to some killer tunes and a wonderful array of action from the last two years of destiny some of the clips may bring forth wonderful memories before we take our first steps into year movie of the week princes of the universe honorable mention saw some strange activity on mars during community week if you d like to put your name in the hat for movie of the week make sure to post your content to the community creations page on bungie net or throw a video to myself or cozmo on twitter this week was home to destiny s th year anniversary as i might still have your attention i d like to tell you a quick story five years ago i was your average bungie community member i worked a retail job in san diego playing videogames into the dead of night and enjoying time with the communities therein i had a few ideas on a future ranging from architecture to graphic design but wasn t set on anything just yet the summer before destiny shipped deej shot me an email asking if i wanted to help show off destiny s upcoming crucible pvp environment at e it was a gamer s dream going to e and playing a new game early surrounded by folks eager to see the new stuff not only did i meet some wonderful people that i have the pleasure of working with today i had the opportunity to make some friends from other corners of the bungie community a few days in i was introduced to a very tall man that went by the name of cozmo he was funny somewhat awkward and seemed to be the type that would throw something at me for no good reason at all all things considered i thought he was a pretty nice guy he d just made a new subreddit to follow the development of destiny while most of what could be found was purely speculation it had already grown into a small community there are many parts of the story that i won t bore you with but it was the beginning of a wonderful friendship that holds to this day destiny has always had that quality about it making friendships a sort of loot that could be acquired through pure luck end of the day i m glad to have found a perfect roll for a fellow community manager even before we had applied for the gig thank you to everyone who shared their stories on how a game could positively impact their lives that s one of the things about community that we love most and we appreciate that you re a part of ours with years behind us it s almost time to take our next step two twab s and a weekend stand between us and shadowkeep feel free

we ll have seven destiny shadowkeep collector s editions to award and those are otherwise sold out our friends at xbox also have some special prizes up their sleeves so tune in to watch or queue up to fight alongside two of the biggest destiny fans we know shake shaxx many of you have been asking how the crucible experience will change on october while we outlined some changes in the director s cut part iii article we wanted to put the magnifying glass on a few more upcoming changes director updatewhen shadowkeep launches your crucible director will look a bit different here s a quick rundown from the director s cut we ve removed the quickplay and competitive nodes from the director if you re looking for an experience like quickplay we ve added classic mix a connection-based playlist like quickplay today classic mix includes control clash and supremacy competitive is replaced by v survival which now awards glory we ve also added a survival solo queue playlist that also awards glory we ve added v control as its own playlist with the potential influx of new players this fall we want to have a playlist that signals to new players where to start we feel like v control is the right starting place when introducing new friends to destiny we ve added a weekly v rotator and a weekly v rotator these rotator playlists are where modes like clash supremacy mayhem lockdown and countdown will appear we want to create some variety in the pvp experience from season to season and one way we re doing that is to bench some maps for the season while they re out of rotation if time allows we also hope to improve how they play by tweaking spawn areas ammo spawns and overall structure so they return better than before the first four to be removed from all playlists are dead cliffslegion s gulchretributionsolitudewe also made a pass on all playlists removing some maps from playlists where they don t shine equinox is now only in scorched mayhem and breakthrough and firebase echo is only in supremacy mayhem and breakthrough while we are removing a few maps we are also introducing widow s court twilight gap and the new map fragment think dreaming city meets infinite forest elimination is also making its return to destiny via crucible labs we ll be testing out multiple variants of elimination rulesets and settings to see how the mode plays with the new weapons and abilities of destiny heavy ammo sharingheavy ammo is shared only in all v modes and those crates have a sparkling effect to denote this once a player picks up heavy ammo their teammates have a limited amount of time currently seconds this is something we can tweak between seasons based on community feedback to interact with the same ammo crate to get heavy ammo if the other team picked up the crate it will turn red to indicate you cannot pick it up during this period when the time window expires the crate despawns each player gets less heavy ammo from shared crates than they do from unshared crates in v and v modes the amount of ammo you receive from a crate is static and does not change based on how many teammates share the crate rank systems update streaks and floorsglory valor and infamy streaks have been made more resilient instead of resetting your streak losses will now reduce your valor and infamy streaks by and your glory streak by you can still lose glory but if your rank is at or below fabled you can t lose glory if doing so would drop you below that rank each rank through fabled acts as a floor for glory competitive matchmaking updates skill and glorydestiny has always tracked player skill behind the scenes taking into account things like kills damage dealt and so forth these factors all contribute to a player s skill rating in season we ve mapped skill ratings to glory ranks with the lowest end of the scale mapping to guardian i and the high end mapping to legend most players are somewhere between these extremes as you play in the survival playlist the glory system will accelerate you to the rank that corresponds to your skill rating if your current rank is below where your skill rating says you should be you ll earn extra glory based on the criteria above so you can get to your expected rank faster and lose less glory so you don t fall farther away once you reach your expected rank glory gains and losses will normalize meanwhile your skill rating is continually adjusting based on your performance shifting the system s understanding of your expected rank and causing the glory system to respond by pulling you toward that rank the result should be that over time your glory rank will become an accurate reflection of your skill it also means that teammates of different skill will experience different glory adjustments from the same survival match when it comes to crucible matchmaking and hopper nodes are only half of the puzzle over the next two weeks we ll be detailing sandbox changes which directly impact the meta that you d find in our pvp environment shadowkeep sandbox update abilitiesas destiny continues to evolve with the upcoming release of shadowkeep many of the tools in your space magic toolbox are receiving a tuning pass this week we ll be focusing on subclass changes as the list is fairly hefty below we ve paired developer commentary with upcoming patch notes to paint a picture of how your abilities are being updated and more importantly why buffsnightstalker way of the pathfinder bottom goal we want to lean into the fantasy of a speedy disruptor pathfinders need more tools to scout the battlefield and a skill based

while staying near allies we want to focus more heavily on buffing allies so that players care about the timing of their buff usage with a loop which allows players to get their melee energy back more quickly this will be a more engaging path to play additionally ward of dawn is currently not up to snuff and needs a buff that ties in to the fantasy of buffing allies defensive strike melee ability

execution headshot kills while crouched grant invisibility and truesighttruesight now lasts seconds down from shattering strike after performing a flawless execution your melee attacks have a longer lunge range and weaken enemiesadvanced warning when we made the change to flawless execution this also unintentionally nerfed this ability to only last seconds it was directly tied to the truesight we have prepared a fix for the patch to restore the weaken and lunge range increase to last the entire seconds regardless of truesight and invisibility status instant reloadinggoal in the beginning lunafactions and rally barricade did exist but they were clunky to use they still had dramatic impact on gameplay even in that state but eventually we decided to make their effects easier to handle the problems they introduced always existed in the game but over time these have become magnified due to new abilities perks and weapons introduced into the destiny sandbox the impact of something that takes all reloading out of the equation means that other perks or effects like the hunter s marksman dodge or the sealed ahamkara s grasps can simply fall to the wayside even swords take a hit in comparison being one of the few weapons that naturally never needs to reload reloading is one of those mechanics that are simple but have wide ranging consequences because the effect on gameplay of removing reloading is inversely proportional to the size of your weapon s magazine and how slow your general reload animations are weapons like rocket launchers and shotguns can benefit greatly compared to other weapons this alongside the increase in general access to damage bonus effects like well of radiance left us with the decision to remove this effect from these two sources as they were causing things to quickly snowball out of control titan rally barricadethis ability now provides a large increase to reload speed for the duration of the effectthis ability no longer automatically reloads your weapons from reserveswarlock rift well of radiancelunafaction boots now provides a large increase to reload speed for the duration of well of radiancethis exotic no longer automatically reloads your weapons from reservessuper energy regenerationgoal these changes will reduce the speed with which players are able to earn their super which supports difficulty and reduces the current ability to trivialize certain content through excessively chaining supers systemically we want to reduce base sources of supers on a large macro scale without diminishing the feeling that your actions are gaining you a worthwhile energy boost by reducing the speed at which you gain super we can make mods and perks feel more worthwhile we still want it to feel like you can make meaningful progress not only through normal play but by augmenting super energy through teamwork class choices gear and skillful play new energy granted by super orbs super orb reduction masterwork orb reduction kills reduction minor elite mini-boss boss player assists reduction minor elite mini-boss boss player damage multipliersgoal at destiny launch damage buffs were fairly sparse there was empowering rift for a small increase and you could combine it with a weakening effect such as hammer strike but very little else as time has gone on we introduced well of radiance weapons of light guiding flame frontal assault etc and combining these effects has resulted in player damage output far beyond what was previously available even with just a small amount of them a player can go from x damage to x and beyond causing there to be an extremely large gap between standard player output and theoretical output by preventing the larger effects from stacking we are able to keep each of them around without having to do something in response like raise boss health to compensate for these tactics as well as create more of them as an example lumina would not have been created in world where the damage bonus effect of noble rounds stacked with other damage effects and these changes are simply an extension along those same lines while the weakening effects never stacked we also took a look at them and adjusted their values as many of our more powerful units would simply evaporate when touched by one of them but we compensated for that in other ways such as either extending the duration of the effect or in the case of shadowshot making it affect power weapons player damage buffsplayer bonusesbonus damage effects that apply to all of a player's weapons simultaneously no longer stack multiplicatively the highest applicable bonus will be used instead this does not affect single weapon buffs such as rampage kill clip or exotic weapons that increase their own damage these will still stack multiplicatively buffs that provide bonus damage will still exist simultaneously on the player so in the event that the one with the highest multiplier wears off the next highest will be used instead this change affects the following weapons abilities empowering rift frontal assault guiding flame sun warrior inertia override well of radiance lumina noble rounds weapons of light notable exceptions vengeance one eyed mask frontal assaultbonus damage is now previously sun warriorbonus damage is now previously well of radiancebonus damage is now previously weapons of lightbonus damage

damage resistancegoal since the launch of destiny we have slowly introduced buffs to supers especially roaming supers while we believe supers should be powerful they should not be mindless we want supers to be more risky in both pve and pvp we want players to think about positioning and timing more not so long ago we experimented with spectral blades by lowering the damage resistance substantially these changes were generally well received and improved the experience of the super for both the person running it and the person who was running from it in pve players shouldn t feel like their super makes them invulnerable and casting one should call for situational strategic thinking in pvp players need to feel like they can challenge a super and that with skillful play there s a chance they can beat it super damage resistance removed from masterwork armorinherent super damage resistance lowered by category see below low- nova warpthunder crashblade barragenova bombwell of

season starts let s dig in and cover the final details before the games begin choose wiselycalus would see you grow fat from strength during season of opulence he will be granting players the chalice of opulence which serves as players gateway to treasure players who emerge victorious in the menagerie will use the chalice to serve up an offering of runes in exchange for the weapons and gear they choose from the selection of items available the treasure you find will be limited at first but over time you ll be able to upgrade the chalice to acquire more plentiful and powerful rewards each player will claim their chalice at the start of the season through an introductory quest line from there it can be shared between different guardians on the same account how does it work earn runes to slot on your chalice through the following completing weekly bountiesopening up the weekly chests on the new nessus bargeusing a consumable that will reward you a rune after a strike crucible or gambit completionthe same consumable will also give other players in your fireteam a chance to earn an additional runeslot the runes into your chalice before you enter the menagerieplay the menagerie to earn your rewardscompleting the menagerie will award you the gear you chose with your rune selections each rune affects what you receive and some of its properties depending on how you slot them it s upgradable you will have a host of new triumphs and bounties to complete that will reward a new currency called imperials using these imperials you can upgrade your chalice to acquire a variety of perks with a wide range of effects from giving you more powerful rewards per week to allowing you to choose the specific gun and masterwork stat you get from the menagerie you can earn imperials several ways completing weekly bountiescompleting certain triumphsusing special consumables that allows for imperial acquisitionchalice upgrades that allow you to earn imperials through playlist activitiesyou choose which upgrades you unlock first unlock additional rune slots to allow more control of an item s specializationupgrade it so you earn more runes or more rune varietyupgrade to allow for additional powerful rewards from the menagerieso for example if you wanted to earn a random roll of a beloved sniper rifle with handling as the masterwork trait you would use a rune of jubilation any red rune and any purple rune this rune configuration is your freebie we re excited for the community to come together and uncover combinations for each menagerie reward we hope this gives you a better idea of how you ll earn weapons and armor during season of opulence you will still have to grind to get that perfect roll but we have given you the option to target the item that you want to optimize and masterwork pinnacle weapons and more last week we promised we would share the details on the new pinnacle weapons coming in season of opulence as well as some other weapons we are buffing here is the destiny dev team to give you one last preview before show time destiny dev team as with season of the drifter we have another three pinnacle weapons to earn in season of opulence vanguard wendigo-gl arc adaptive grenade launcher wendigo-gl s unique perk is explosive light picking up an orb of light increases the next grenade s blast radius and damage unlike most drum grenade launchers wendigo-gl comes with blinding grenades as its magazine option for some added utility to shut down teleporting taken captains or that cabal gladiator about to get in your faceyou can carry up to six grenades enhanced by explosive light so be sure to not let any orbs of light slip through your fingers when you ve got this weapon equipped crucible revoker kinetic aggressive sniper rifle revoker s unique perk is reversal of fortune missing a shot returns the bullet to the magazine after a short duration even the greatest of snipers is not a perfect sharpshooter and you miss every shot you don t takerevoker was built with the mindset that you should always go for it but keep in mind that reversal of fortune can only return a single bullet at a timealong with its unique perk this sniper has a custom low zoom ambush slh scope and snapshot for those close quarters battlesacquiring revoker will not require reaching fabled rank in competitiveplayers will need to earn total glory pointsyou do not lose progress when losing a match gambit hush solar precision combat bow hush s unique perk is archer s gambit hipfire precision hits grant a massive draw speed bonus for a short duration this weapon is for those who would proclaim mastery with the combat bowarcher s gambit pays out significantly better than archer s tempo but it s going to take a more skilled hand to get the most out of itmake those shots count we also have a few weapons and archetypes getting some tuning to make them more effective contrary to a popular meme we will be buffing fusion rifles this season fusion riflesnon-exotic fusion riflesdamage increased against pve combatantshigh-impact increased by precision increased by adaptive increased by rapid-fire increased by while some of the exotic fusion rifles telesto j tunn merciless did receive minor adjustments due to inheriting from their legendary counterparts they re minor increases under each this change was done to move legendary fusion rifles a little closer to the exotics as the gap between them was quite large at least in pve sturm and drangstorm and stress max overcharge rounds increased to sturm overcharge buff text now displays the number of overcharge roundsovercharge damage increased by in pvesturm and drang were weapons that lost a bit of their place in pve once forsaken hit not being able to carry around a special weapon hurts your output so sturm fell to the wayside with these changes along with a new version of drang coming out in the season of opulence we hope that it has some time to shine

       " Document(page_content=\"this week at bungie we are hosting lord saladin one last time in the season of the drifter the final iron banner for this season rages on this is your last chance to finish up any of the triumphs or maybe get that ridiculous emblem if you like to show off we ll have some slight changes to iron banner next season we ll give you the full details on what to expect the week before saladin returns to the tower in season of opulenceseason of opulence sandbox changes season of opulence is on fast approach and similar to past seasons some sandbox changes will arrive with it last week we set your sights on a new raid that begins on june the same day that the new season launches we wanted to let you know what to expect from the new sandbox so you can plan accordingly the destiny dev team has the details destiny dev team for season of opulence several notable weapons are being adjusted we want to ensure that encounters raids and other endgame content for example remain a challenge some of these weapons have been overwhelming that challenge our first choice is to buff underused weapons but if we continue to push every weapon up higher and higher it will be impossible to maintain challenging experiences this is not a full list of changes but some of the most impactful whisper of the wormwhisper of the worm was already adjusted in season of the drifter but an exotic that can generate an infinite amount of heavy ammo is still a gigantic outlier and renders many weapons irrelevant for certain encounters while exotics are intended to be powerful and novel bypassing the ammo economy can tend to force us to adjust enemies to compensate this effectively results in sniper rifles as a whole being punished because of whisper s unique ammo ability as a result we re removing the ammo generation ability so that we can increase the effectiveness of all other snipers that don t have an endless ammo supply white nail pulls ammo from reserves rather than creating itreserve ammunition increased to without ammo reserve perks sleeper simulantthe reduction of bounced shot damage for sleeper simulant is already present on several important enemies we are now making this reduction part of the weapon the difference in damage is too large between a single precision shot of sleeper simulant and an angled shot that pierces the target and then also hits the target again with the bounced projectiles much like whisper we ve had to adjust enemies around that potential by making these changes a permanent part of the weapon we can get it into a more balanced position reduced ricochet bounce damage on boss combatantsmodified precision behavior total damage is unchanged but non-precision shots are significantly more forgivinglord of wolveslord of wolves received a massive increase in damage with the full benefits of the shotgun changes in season of the drifter this made it a lot more popular but we got a significant amount of feedback that release the wolves activating on every kill made it difficult to control the weapon s ammo consumption as a result we re allowing you to swap between the two states to control the output while also reducing its output slightly pve damage reduced by release the wolves perk has been reworked no longer triggers automatically on killthis effect is now triggered by holding reload similar to the fundamentals on hard light and borealispve damage and range bonuses on this effect has been removed and replaced with a universal damage bonus instead ace of spadesace of spades is pretty hot in the crucible and has been since its inclusion in destiny forsaken the number of perks on the weapon combined with the semi-permanent effect of memento mori gives the weapon too many advantages compared to other weapons now that memento mori ends when you stow the weapon you ll need to make a decision on whether or not you ll keep the weapon drawn to retain the bonus memento mori now ends if the weapon is stowedthe pvp damage bonus of memento mori was slightly reduced to prevent two-tapping guardians while vengeance one-eyed mask was activespecifically you need four resilience to survive thismemento mori is active for six shots again up from five exotic armoralong with the weapons above we will also be making some changes to some exotic armor pieces primarily we re paying attention to pieces of exotic armor that grant back super energy we felt they are increasingly becoming must-pick gear choices orb generation from teammates is meant to be the best way to accelerate your super generation these exotics are allowing players to bypass this teamwork mechanic by generating a large amount of super energy without relying on other players orbs also because these items are so overwhelmingly strong in situations where players face off against large numbers of enemies some activities were designed considering the use of armor such as orpheus rigs phoenix protocol skull of dire ahamkara etc this means if someone in your fireteam doesn't have these super exotics equipped the activity becomes far more difficult we are making some changes to these armor pieces to try to preserve their power fantasy and still leave them as viable choices for difficult activities without making players feel like they must have them equipped or be at a huge disadvantage super-generating exotic armor changesskull of dire ahamkara orpheus rigs and phoenix protocol now receive super energy back with diminishing returns making it rarer to get a full super backshards of galanor and ursa furiosa had their super gain caps reduced to be in parity with other super exotic changesgwisin vest had its energy reduced from to for killing one to two guardiansstill scales up similar to before when killing three or more guardianspve energy return remains similar to beforewe re sympathetic about the fact that the changes we make in the interest of balancing combat and game design can be jarring it was important that we have this conversation before you read the patch notes we know many of you have a lot riding on day one of season of opulence hopefully this intel will assist you in

some changes currently in development for season of opulence which is a bit further out read on to learn how the pinnacle hand cannons of destiny will be changing balance the bite at the release of destiny forsaken two pinnacle weapons became available for players to earn in the competitive playlist in the crucible each weapon has a unique quest requiring mastery of hand cannons to complete there has been a lot of feedback on how the pinnacle crucible hand cannons stand above most other weapons in the sandbox today we ll be going through some balance changes planned for season of opulence we wanted to start this conversation early to ensure players understood that change was coming even if they were still on the path to acquiring these rewards here s the destiny dev team to walk us through the planned changes dev team we wanted to give you a preview of some plans we have to balance luna s howl and not forgotten in season of opulence after significant amounts of feedback internal discussion and playtesting we ve decided to adjust how these hand cannons work for some players these weapons can represent a significant investment of time and the personal improvement needed to acquire them when tuning we attempt to take into account the time commitment players make to acquire weapons and balance that against how those weapons affect the different game modes magnificent howl the unique perk on these weapons is too effective it works in a neutral setting and rewards players for getting precision shots something they would have done naturally as a result the time to kill of the game shifts to meet this new benchmark and players feel that the majority of primary weapons in destiny cannot compete with these pinnacle weapons our current plan is to make luna s howl and not forgotten the only rpm precision hand cannons they will maintain some aspects of their current behavior while taking on the firing speed and damage of the rpm hand cannons magnificent howl will also be adjusted so that it increases only body-shot damage resulting in a two headshot one body-shot kill magnificent howl will still give an advantage due to requiring less precision hits for optimal time to kill like we do whenever destiny gameplay evolves we ll be watching the conversation starting today on our planned changes we ll continue collecting feedback once these changes go live at the beginning of season of opulence if you have feedback now please make sure to sound off on the destiny forum right here on bungie netrevelry verdant lightlast week revelry orbs were disabled in gambit gambit prime raids and competitive crucible due to an increase in guitar errors and activity disconnections as multiple sources of progress for the verdant light competitive triumph are no longer available the team has been investigating a change to the requirements for completion as the above listed activities no longer provide progress players are required to create orbs by defeating other guardians with precision kills in quickplay rumble and the featured crucible playlist this week that playlist is iron banner for example at this time our current plan is to reduce this requirement to orbs this change will be deployed after the revelry ends in destiny update players who meet the requirement of orbs will have the triumph auto-complete after downloading the patch which will also unlock the party harder triumph and stimulant spring emblem reward if all other revelry triumphs have been completed exploring the curse last month we featured a

line with the low end while stealth is active with stealth vision through walls and fast shifty movement this super ability actually has a lot of built-in survivability this means a lower dr will demand better planning and positioning to survive for multiple kills which lines up well with the fantasy of the path this is also a first step toward trying out a roaming super with lower damage reduction so let us know what you think super durationsuper length out of stealth with no attacking - secondssuper length in stealth with no attacking - secondslight melee cost increased by basically we reduced the duration by seconds overall we want you to feel like you have time to plan in stealth with the understanding that you need to be deliberate and swift with your strikes additionally we increased the cost of the light melee attack it may seem like a lot on paper but previously it was almost nothing now you need to think just a little bit before spamming away we didn t want to make it cost too much as it s the only way to chase people down but it did need to have at least a small visible cost to make it more of a choice gwisin vestwe are looking at gwisin vest now and playing with some changes we also want to see how these initial changes go if we decide to change gwisin you will see it in season kilts for kidsin its eighth year seattle ronald mcdonald house is hosting its

       " Document(page_content=\"this week at bungie we re getting ready for some high voltage a storm is brewing next week we ll kick off what we ve been calling arc week our goal for this happening has been to take the element that makes our sandbox crackle and put it under the microscope the most noticeable update is that we improved many arc subclass paths from the time before forsaken the week will also feature arc singe and arc bounties to synergize with your updated abilities to provide a proving grounds for all this new energy mayhem will be available in the crucible to let you experiment with your enhanced arc abilities using shockingly short cooldowns arc week will also feature one of the most powerful arc weapons ever created the thunderlord exotic machine gun if you weren t able to complete the quest to obtain thunderlord last year you will have from april to april to revisit the cosmodrome and add it your collection a spark can give life or take it arc week buffs up several arc subclasses designer dan gniady has all the details on what changes you can expect dan after the release of forsaken the sandbox team wanted to revisit some older subclass paths and freshen them up a bit this entailed tuning for balance as well as quality-of-life fixes we ve also added new functionality to a couple of subclasses in update we're focusing on arc subclasses for titans hunters and warlocks to kick off arc week that said we also made a couple needed changes to non-arc abilities let s get into it striker code of the juggernaut bottom path notes this path is all about punching enemies to get better at shooting them and shooting enemies to get better at punching them we want to further incentivize engaging in this loop and make doing so move visible and flashy shooting an enemy should make you feel like you are primed to strike with melee punching an enemy and releasing your rage will make you feel like a more focused shot frontal assault now increases all weapon damage for the duration of the buff against combatants against playersduration increased from to secondsbuff timer is now displayed on the hudknockout melee damage bonus increased from to now also triggers once you have dealt damage to a targetany damage done after will refresh the timerstill also triggers off shield popno longer consumed after melee attackduration increased from to secondsarcstrider way of the warrior top path notes this path thrives on striking with precision and timing and is heavily melee focused to enhance this loop we are giving it a bit more nuance with a higher potential payout we want to allow for more room to execute and engage with both the path to success and the benefits once you do succeed combination blowbonus melee damage can now be stacked times requires a melee ability kill for each stack buff increases melee damage by per stack in pve buff increases melee damage by per stack in pvpfor comparison this ability used to be stack and increased melee damage by kills with this ability now heal health in addition to starting health regen deadly reach increased buff duration from to seconds buff is no longer consumed by a melee hitarcstrider way of the wind bottom path notes this path is about quick movement and thriving under pressure we want to increase your ability to survive while at low health and enhance your elusiveness so you can be more confident when in danger this way you don't just get a bonus when you re injured you have more control over what state you are in and you can make more risk reward choices disorienting blow increased the disorient distance by increased duration of disorient on players from to secondsfocused breathing increased dodge recharge bonus while sprinting by combat

conduction top path notes this path focuses prominently on chain lightning but we also want to better sell the fantasy of being a god of erratic and dangerous energy we want you to be delighted and surprised by the chaos you cause on top of that we should make the choice of using your abilities something to better strategize around and reward you for doing so chain lightning meleecan now chain up to times up from and each individual target can be hit twicechain damage decreased from to damage per chain hitarc webcan now chain to many many more targets and back and forth between targetsthe

web chains and chains from chain lightning meleeearn energy per instance of chain damage in pveearn energy per instance of chain damage in pvpstormcaller attunement of the elements bottom path notes currently this path focuses on creating drone buddies for allies and staying close to them to dish out more rifts and the buddies therein generally arc drone is short-lived and you need to stay close to your rift to keep it around now you will be able to take your pal further and if you stick with friends will be able to have it around much more often making this path more potent as support electrostatic surge increased bonus regeneration rate of rift by per nearby friendly guardianthis sounds insane and it s a big boost you will definitely feel but it was previously very low extends rift duration from to secondsadded a ui notification for when the buff is activearc soul extended duration by now let s talk about some non-arc changes as well voidwalker nova warp supernotes clearly we swung a bit hard when we hit this previously this should serve as a nice middle ground to settle into reduced initial charged detonation energy cost by reduced energy cost of holding the charged detonation by reduced time required to fully charge the charged detonation from seconds to secondsreduced dark blink cost by increased base super duration from seconds to secondsdawnblade everlasting fire perknotes similar to the striker we wanted to make sure this perk didn t allow for infinite supers in certain activities we ve increased the amount you get back upfront but put diminishing returns on it so you can t go forever this will still be a super you can extend much longer with skill tuned the amount of super gained from everlasting fireinitial return increased from to super energyreturn then decays linearly over the course of kills from to returned per killyou may be asking what about spectral blades we know it s out of bounds and are working right now on a few tweaks to bring it back in line we ll let you know the details once we ve finished play testing and tuning to lock in on what the changes will be that s all for me this time as always we look forward to you

to gambit and gambit prime matchmaking to tune your experience refreshing each tuesday guardians look forward to a new set of objectives and challenges to complete in the world of destiny rotating crucible modes new bounties to complete and every so often a curse week in the dreaming city for some time now we ve been encountering issues where some of our resets would catch bad streaks preventing players from completing various triumphs or earning their desired titles we ve taken some time to address these issues and wanted to give an update on status nightfallsthis week the corrupted is available for forsaken owners to complete if this is the last checkmark you need for the dreaming city seal make sure you head to the dreaming city before the weekly reset moving forward we ll be putting effort into preventing streaks where specific nightfalls appear multiple weeks in a row or don t appear at all for months and we ll be making sure your experience tackling strikes associated with seals isn t feast or famine ada- weapon frameswhile weapon frames aren t tied to any specific seals we understand that players are on the hunt for new and exciting rolls on their favorite weapons since black armory released there have been a few streaks where sniper rifle or machine gun frames didn t appear for many weeks in a row in destiny update ada- will begin offering all weapon frames each week while players will still be limited in how many different frames they may acquire per week we are removing the weekly rotation as destiny continues to evolve throughout the annual pass and beyond we ll continue to deliver quality-of-life changes like the ones described above to address common feedback items some changes may come more quickly than others but we ll continue to deploy updates to provide a better player experience speaking of these changes read on for a quick preview of our next update destiny update preview tentatively planned for april destiny update will bring a variety of quality-of-life changes and bug fixes below is a short list of topics that we commonly see in the wild note if any issues are found in the final weeks of development the

we ll be celebrating arc energy in season of the drifter security update members of our security response team spend their days swinging the banhammer against those suspected of cheating they also inform players they they need to work on improving their network connections this week we have a few updates on their efforts security response team our mandate is to safeguard the experience of our players against those opponents who would detract from your fun in the destiny universe today we want to talk about two different initiatives we ve been focused on recently aimbots vs macrosit s important to us that people with disabilities be able to use accessibility tools which sometimes include simple automation it s one of the reasons why we fixed the titan skating macro issue in-game instead of simply punishing people running automation tools however there is a clear line between macros and aimbots players who stray into the latter territory will find themselves no longer welcome in the destiny universe we re currently in the process of banning a number of players on pc who have been detected using aimbots to unnaturally augment their skill defeating your opponents whether they re ai or other guardians should always be about your own skill we ll continue to make sure that s the case plugging inin december we announced that we would begin issuing warnings and restrictions to players with extremely poor network connections that lasted for a prolonged period of time we re happy to report that of the players who received a warning have not been detected for having a poor connection again for people who have struggled to improve their connection after receiving a warning we want to be clear stability is more important than speed latency and packet loss are the biggest concerns for destiny not throughput mbps here are a few choice quotes from our network troubleshooting guide while average bandwidth usage is considerably lower destiny may request up to mbps download and upload bandwidth destiny creates connections between a player's console bungie s servers and other players in a unique way as such network performance in other games and applications is often not a good indicator that the network is setup for a stable connection to destiny the most common sources of lag and frequent disconnects are high latency and packet loss we encourage players who receive a warning or restriction due to their network connection to visit the latency and packet loss section of our network troubleshooting guide finally thank you to the players who have used the player report features in-game and on bungie net to help us identify opponents who are hurting your experience while we ll never rely on player reports alone to issue restrictions it is incredibly helpful for corroborating the hard data we gather time for prime two weeks ago we made some adjustments to gambit matchmaking to help even the playing field to give a refresh of what the change was and why it was made here s some context from a previous edition of this week at bungie gambit is a team-based activity as such players who are in a pre-made fireteam have a communication advantage to offset that advantage we've raised the internal skill rating of pre-made fireteams to pull in higher skill enemies to fight against with this change even as a solo player you'll still have a chance plus your other matched fireteam mates should be higher skilled as well after modifying normal gambit settings to try to create fairer matches we re-evaluated the settings and have further tweaks to try to get them even fairer we ve also now had a chance to collect data on gambit prime and are applying these changes to gambit prime matchmaking to take advantage of our findings the changes to gambit prime matchmaking are live now if you encounter any issues please report your experience to the help forum on bungie net iron support whether you re on the road to increasing your power or taking your first steps as a guardian destiny player support is at the ready to get you the information you need for success if you need an assist you can find then in the

strengthen your coreas you make progress in season of the drifter you ll be making choices about which weapons and armor you want to power up first we ve been following the conversation around the use of enhancement cores for infusion as a response the destiny dev team have some changes lined up that they want to share destiny dev team the goal of the infusion system is to create an impactful feeling of progression when you increase the power of an item you enjoy using an infusion system with no scarcity around the materials would diminish this impact to that end we tapped into a material with inherent scarceness enhancement cores to use as one of the keystone materials for this process that is the goal the infusion system but if the overall system is causing a negative experience we want to work to improve it we re constantly monitoring the infusion economy to see what kind of impact it has on gear usage we keep a close eye on the amount of infusion materials being earned versus how many are being used and will continue to make adjustments as needed to that end we ll be making a change in season of opulence with the goal of providing more access to enhancement cores scrapper bounties previously dropped randomly when dismantling gear there was no reliable way to earn enhancement cores using these bounties and we didn t feel they were providing enough materials we will be deprecating these bounties at the start of season note that any unfinished scrapper bounties still in your inventory when the new season begins can still be completed before their natural expiration in their place the gunsmith will now offer a selection of daily and weekly bounties that can be purchased for gunsmith materials as with the scrapper bounties each of these will include among other things an enhancement core as a reward when completed our hope is that this increased access and control over enhancement core acquisition will help improve the balance of materials being earned vs materials being used as always we ll be continuously monitoring this item economy along with your feedback to assess its effectiveness who do you truly serve season of the drifter offers your characters an interesting choice your decision impacts your experience with both the story and the world around you so far we ve enjoyed watching the debate between team drifter and team vanguard we wanted to give you a little insight into where the community has been pledging their allegiance the following two graphics show which side is receiving the most pledges the first graph is an account-level look and looks at data on which side you pledged to first the second is character based and takes into account all the characters that pledged overall account-level character-level so

       " Document(page_content=\"this week at bungie the drifter is preparing for a turn to lead the next season we re nearing the end of season of the forge guardians have plundered the black armory of its secrets and weapons shaxx hosted crimson days and lord saladin is watching over the final iron banner of the season before the drifter takes center stage we ll be hosting a raid-along

past raid alongdate tuesday february time am pm pstwatch twitch tv bungie members of the raid test team will be fighting the good fight as designers artists producers and more lend commentary on taking an idea and creating the greatest challenge our game has to offer alright alright alright to get gambit primed for the season of the drifter we have been working on some quality of life improvements we re changing the way this little game is played based on our own experience as players and a lot of feedback that we ve collected since forsaken launched today senior designer robbie stevens is speaking on behalf of the team to take us through the changes you can expect on march robbie as we build on the gambit theme in season of the drifter we want to make sure to address some of the top feedback items for the base activity below is a sneak peek of changes we ve made based on the community s feedback expect more details and additional quality-of-life changes for gambit when season of the drifter drops on march changed the third round of gambit to a primeval rush sudden death this will speed up gambit matches overall and add a change of pace to the final round overhauled how we choose the invader spawn location and increased the number of invader spawn points for each map this should greatly reduce the chances of spawning very near or in direct line of sight of an enemy guardian implemented idle protection which means that players that remain dormant for too long will not receive end-of-match rewards or infamy points the triumph light vs light can now be progressed by killing any guardian using a super not just invaders this makes attaining the dredgen title a less daunting task adjustments to blocker types by deposit tier small blocker taken goblin with less health than the previous phalanx medium blocker taken captain with more health than the previous knight large blocker taken knight with more health than the previous ogre these changes arrive with the season of the drifter to get you ready for the change in seasons we re enabling triple infamy for the final week of season of the forge triple infamystart am pstend are you looking to become a dredgen and impress the drifter or maybe acquire a few weapons to round out your collection wins losses and bounties will all reward you with increased infamy throughout the week back to the sandbox alongside the gambit quality-of-life changes our sandbox team will be fine-tuning some weapon archetypes to refresh the gameplay experience in destiny the following is a quick preview of some changes coming with destiny update with developer commentary from sandbox designer victor anderson linear fusion riflesthese energy weapons have dominated gambit for quite some time first came sleeper simulant then came the queenbreaker we ve made them less forgiving so we can enjoy a change of pace linear fusion rifle aim-assist values will receive an adjustment to reduce effectiveness at very long ranges while queenbreaker has high aim-assist values by default we discovered an issue where it was not honoring aim-assist values that applied to other linear fusion rifles of the same archetype this resulted in queenbreaker having over double the intended aim assist linear fusion rifles will receive a damage increase in pve to compensate for the above changes shotgunsin season of the drifter we re making a few changes to rapid-fire shotguns and the full auto perk we're doing this for a few reasons one of them being that the full auto perk feels far too important to shotguns in pve this perk effectively doubles the damage output of any given shotgun due to the rate of fire increase while we believe it is important to have useful perks on your weapons the efficacy of this was so impactful that rapid-fire shotguns became the only shotguns worth considering for pve when the following changes release in season of the drifter we hope you might be inspired to equip an aggressive shotgun or maybe even take a slug shotgun for a spin in a pve activity shotguns will receive a damage multiplier in pve activities effectively doubling their damage the legend of acrius is an exception to this full auto rate-of-fire bonus for shotguns is now down from in addition it no longer increases the shotgun pellet spread default rate-of-fire values for have also shifted aggressives are rpm up from rpmprecisions are rpm up from rpmlightweights are rpm they were erroneously stated to be rpm previously rapid-fire rpm down from rpm they were previously natively rpm but due to the intrinsic full auto actually had rpm also reduced base damage for shotguns across the board to align with their new rates of fire on a per sub-archetype basis ammo reserves for shotguns were re-evaluated due to the increased efficiency of having more damage per shot we also took the opportunity to slightly adjust shotguns for the crucible while shotguns will remain effective in the crucible we have toned down the range at which shotguns could secure a one-shot kill additionally the team has some information regarding balance changes for the one-eyed mask exotic which will release with update one-eyed maskin various combat situations one-eyed mask has been too effective and has become a non-choice exotic for titans in pvp environments after implementing the following changes we believe the exotic will still be potent if used well but there will be more opportunities to counter it the duration of the mark of vengeance has been reduced from seconds to secondsthe way players refill health after a successful kill has changed before it restored all of your health and the overshield refilled over time now the health refills over time alongside the overshield this should give a leg up when encountering situations where multiple people are fighting one person with the one-eyed mask equipped vengeance will no longer trigger for players in super this was making supers far too potent a new season means a new reality in combat keep up the chatter and we ll keep curating the sandbox so that destiny adapts to the way you play they ll be your guide navigating the

pstwatch twitch tv bungiefind us beat us and claim a sign of mutual combat emblem until then we have some news to cover let s dive in skating at the speed of light when destiny launched on pc some titans among you were quick to realize that they could break the sound barrier through tricky input methods the sandbox team has been hard at work looking at ways to address this issue without impacting general movement for the titan class we are currently planning for changes to be implemented in destiny update coming in march to address titan skating here are the details sandbox later this month we are fixing an issue with the titan lift ability that currently allows players with the use of unconventional inputs keybinding to mouse scrollwheel macros etc to reach extremely excessive movement speeds it will still be possible to maximize your lift speed by skillfully timing your lift activation inputs to boost your overall momentum in other words titan skating is still possible just less excessive some of you may be asking why this is being addressed players utilizing these unconventional methods are effectively able to exceed the bounds of expected guardian movement speed so drastically that it creates an unfair advantage when it comes to the fundamentals of combat gameplay like aiming positioning and even networking to some degree we understand that many players value and enjoy this behavior as a core part of the overall skillset and identity of the titan class however we d rather continue to build on the titan identity and fantasy of being a fast-moving aggressive jetpack warrior by continuing to build new fully supported abilities our goal is to create abilities that are fun effective and skillful without requiring special hardware or macros to access them players who do not use macros should not feel any difference once this change is deployed this strictly addresses lift acceleration issues on pc players who don t utilize unconventional input methods should feel no difference we encourage you to keep an eye out for any inconsistencies and to let us know if this change does not meet your expectations for how lift should

trying to create stronger clans where players can make new friends in destinystronger incentives for clans to play with their clanmates we feel good about how many of these changes affected large and strong clans but we ve also received a ton of feedback from the community that the forsaken changes effected smaller and less hardcore clans less positively these clans feel like they can no longer hit the levels they had in the past we also heard that there is just too much emphasis on doing daily bounties as a result of this feedback we took some of the clan progression mechanics back to the workbench and made changes to improve the experience starting in season we re returning to the destiny launch system for gaining clan experience go play activities in the game and you will earn clan xp and level up your clan as a result daily clan bounties are no longer needed and have been removed from the game there are now three weekly bounties that require playing with your clanmates to

bounties grow at rank three you earn mod components when completing a weekly bounty at rank four you earn enhancement cores when completing a weekly bounty at rank six your clan will unlock a fourth weekly bounty we also wanted to briefly talk about the tier perk for season the perk reads crucible and strike catalysts have an increased drop rate when playing with clanmates for those of you who

you missed out on crimsons days last year or didn t get everything you wanted you re in luck this is your chance to get the rewards exclusive to this event the event is very similar to last year but we have added a few new rewards and ways of obtaining them we ll give you the full details closer to the special day cleaning house starting with season of the drifter we re making a slight change to the way bounties grant powerful rewards to ensure an even playing field each time we kick off a new season bounties acquired during previous seasons will have a maximum possible power reward this change is intended to prevent players from feeling the need to hoard bounties and raid keys that grant powerful rewards until the power cap is raised in an attempt to get a leg up in the push toward the new power cap example a player has completed the wanted silent fang bounty during the season of the forge but has not yet claimed the reward if they claim this reward after the season of the drifter has begun the reward will have a maximum power of if they instead acquire this bounty after the season of the drifter has already begun the reward will have a maximum power of the cap is applied to bounties on acquisition note completed bounties have no mechanism to dismantle so keeping completed bounties could negatively affect players for the first week of a new season by holding on to the old bounties this locks players out of an uncapped bounty that could become available with the start of a new season we strongly recommend either completing or discarding any powerful rewards bounties before the new season begins completing these bounties after the season changes could result in missing out on the new season s version of the bounty with the higher power cap we are also looking to address stockpiles of raid keys as well we are currently finalizing details and will give additional information when available final previewwe ve talked about a lot of changes coming next

       " Document(page_content=\"this week at bungie we continue our journey before we dive into the weekly roundup of information about the game we d like to shed some more light on the future of the franchise destiny franchise director luke smith hey everyone i wanted to share three things on behalf of the destiny team today first our sincere thanks to the people at activision who've helped bring destiny to our players high moon studios for their wonderful collaboration on forsaken and vicarious visions who helped establish a destiny community on pc worked with us on warmind and who is currently readying their destiny swan song with content that will appear in the upcoming season of redacted next in the short-term we're continuing to build the content we ve promised for the annual pass we've learned a lot from black armory that we will apply to future releases most notably that we'd like the beginning experiences of content drops to be a better point of convergence for the playerbase in black armory we set the power requirement for the first forge too high and that meant it wasn't a great chance to jump into some new content we want to find the line between new content that many players can play and aspirational content for players to progress toward we're exploring improvements to catch-up mechanics for players in upcoming seasons last long-term bungie is committed to destiny we created the universe and we hold its future entirely in our hands the vast majority of the team is hard at work envisioning future experiences enemies and ways to play the guardian you've been building since we're going to keep doing that we're thinking about what it means to be truly independent what it means to self-publish and crucially what destiny's future can now look like for our players it was a busy fall and it is going to be a busy year when i look ahead and think about destiny and where it could go i see a bright future with roots in a memorable past not everything has been lost in the dark corners of time see you soon -luke up the damage paired with changes to super abilities in destiny update the team has is also set to deliver some fine-tuning to weapon archetypes in your vault waiting to be used designer victor anderson has a rundown of our goals and the changes being made to reach them mr anderson in the update we re making several adjustments to weapons with the following goals in mind buff underutilized weapon archetypesadjust hot button weapons in pvp including telesto and wavesplitteravoid pvp adjustments that will negatively affect pve efficacyin summary our design philosophy is to keep the sandbox feeling the same but tune damage separately dependent on activity where it makes sense here s a sampling of some the changes you ll see weapon archetypesauto riflesdamage increased for rapid-fire adaptive and high-impact families we find that auto rifles are a little unforgiving for the ranges they ask you to occupy in a world with special weapons and as a result we re increasing the damage to offset the higher risk scout riflesdamage increased for lightweight and rapid-fire families as well as an increase to all scout rifles in pve scout rifles are always going to be on the lower end of damage due to the safety that their range affords you but the difference currently between them and other primary weapons is too drastic as a result we re reducing the size of the gap sniper riflesincreased the damage on the rapid-fire archetype to be able to kill in two bodyshots although snipers are still finding success we believe that allowing you to clean up a kill easier with a sniper rifle will allow the sniper to have that success at more ranges and in more situations exotic weapons legend of acrius increased the damage and bumped out the range slightly as time moves on things tend to trend upward in terms of power and in a post-forsaken world acrius simply didn t have the output to match other heavy weapon exotics telestopvp damage brought down to match a standard fusion rifle charge rate optics zoom was also increased to match fusion rifles with long-range scopes telesto has become fairly notorious in the crucible for its effectiveness even in some cases getting accidental multikills due to how damaging the explosions were to combat these we ve reduced its pvp damage to match its charge rate this brought up an issue where doing so was significantly hurting the usability of the weapon so the optics were buffed in return in general you should still find it an effective weapon it just won t be quite as generous as it was before trace riflesincreased the minimum amount of ammo you could receive from special ammo boxes trace rifles had a pretty rough time keeping ammo reserves in the crucible as it doesn t have access to scavenger perks you should have more success using it more often in the crucible now and the changes also affect pve bricks reduced the strength of wavesplitter in pvp after the ammo changes noted above wavesplitter had its one weakness removed so we ve opted to bring it in line with the other trace rifles before this patch hit the public weapon tuning is an ongoing process we ll be sure to talk to you about it again in the future some topics we re looking at for future potential adjustments include trace rifle damage in pve submachine gun damage adjustments shotgun adjustments and taking a holistic look at the heavy slot options and how much of an impact it has on loadout choices for pve content we are always looking at what s currently in use and what isn t in use as having more choices is always better than being locked into a narrow band these changes are currently planned to land on january stoke the forgesandbox won t be the only aspect of destiny receiving quality of life changes in the next update we ve also spent some time collecting player feedback on the black armory experience what follows are some details for the changes we have

community player support and bungie net teams have been meeting to discuss some ways we can improve the experience on our forums the first change will be a reorganization of our current forum structure paired with some under-the-hood improvements to moderation tools a large piece of feedback that we re looking to address is that players didn t know exactly where to go to join the

       " Document(page_content=\"this week at bungie the fourth forge was unlocked but not in the way we intended sometimes at bungie we try new things on many occasions in the past we have enjoyed watching as the community worked together to solve puzzles that was the idea behind niobe labs as the puzzle hunt started to drag on for too long guardians watched from the sidelines eager to forge some new weapons the feedback was clear puzzles are fun but not when they gate content you were expecting to play we re flexible enough to change a plan when it s not playing out as we had hoped so we decided to give annual pass owners access to the bergusia forge the final forge is open now niobe labs is still waiting to be solved some of the clues in the niobe labs puzzle are not as clear as we intended our designers are looking into this and will have a clarifying update at pm pst if you are still interested in helping solve it keep an eye on our forum we ll share the link from bungie as well we will be applying what we learned from this activity to experiences we re creating for future releases thanks for playing over before the holidays we mentioned some sandbox changes coming up at the end of this month we re excited to shake things up a little bit specifically with how your most powerful abilities spread destruction here is designer dan gniady with some designer commentary on the changes we have planned dan hello super aficionados it s dang here to tell you about upcoming changes to subclasses in the update you will experience fresh changes to most of the supers and a couple goodies here and there for the subclasses at large if you want just the quick takeaway damage was increased for most supers and slightly reduced for blade barrage and nova warp and we ve injected a couple new tricks into some of the older subclass paths keep reading for a more detailed look josh hamrick recently touched on our upcoming plans for sandbox and we wanted to expand on our intentions a bit further these are some of the goals guiding us as frequently as possible continue to shift the combat meta with sandbox updates to keep destiny freshinvestigate and improve outliers underperformers in terms of popularity or effectiveness to keep all of your given sandbox options feeling like relevant and effective choicesaddress major quality of life sandbox issues reported by the community to maintain a smooth and consistent gameplay experience in destinyin this specific update our goal was to look at supers holistically across the board bringing up damage where they underperform fixing some major pain points and adding new functionality where inspiration struck to accomplish this we did the following compiled community feedbacklooked at data both usage rates and effectivenessplaytested changes and continued adjustingso specifically which supers got a bump damage increases golden gun three-shot and six-shooter shadowshot moebius quiver arc staffburning maulhammer of sol code of the siegebreaker fist of havocsentinel shieldnova bomb cataclysm and vortex daybreaksmall damage decrease blade barragenova warpthis is the beginning of a process we believe we ve found a good place around which to balance the subclasses this means a few outliers will come down a bit but most will be brought up it will involve changes to super damage tuning numbers on perks to make them more effective or even wholesale replacing them when they aren t performing below you will find the very start of these changes if you don t see a particular improvement you were hoping for know that there will be more to come and please continue to let us know what you think as we make changes we appreciate your feedback and share in your passion huntergunslingerchanges

seconds up from every secondnotes for code of the earthshaker the change to terminal velocity should make it more engaging the first tier is now easier to achieve for the second tier you ll probably want some high ground but if all you have is flat land a directional slam near the peak of your lift can proc it finally there s a new third tier that will require some serious height to activate on top of that you ll not only need to land your hang time slams but also do it quickly enough to get in all four possible to maximize damage with code of the juggernaut if you play it right you can extend your super for minutes in pve i know this sounds crazy but it takes foresight and strategic choices the light shoulder attack is almost a movement mode with the new cheaper cost with the

when you put hands to controllers keyboards and mice this is the current plan but things could change in the next few weeks the official patch notes will ship with the update which is currently slated for january making matches next week we will adjust matchmaking settings in competitive this change is scheduled to take effect on january at am pst the world systems team has been gathering feedback and using it in conjunction with player data to make the next change for how we match opponents in the competitive playlist we will be changing the matchmaking parameters so that opponents you find in

back out there in the wild this is their report shredding guitarsshortly after the launch of destiny forsaken destiny player support began monitoring player reports describing intermittent guitar errors in the final encounters of the last wish raid these errors have been especially impactful to players attempting the petra s run triumph which requires fireteams to complete the last wish raid in a single session with no deaths after comprehensive investigation we currently believe that last wish guitar errors occur when players hit the limit on the number of server-controlled objects within a single area this issue is exacerbated during the final encounter in last wish when encounter-specific objects are left over from the riven fight reaching this limit causes the server to crash resulting in guitar errors for all players our teams are working to identify this issue s root cause and are currently testing solutions to resolve these elevated errors while no strict timeline can be guaranteed possible solutions are being tested with the intent of shipping in destiny update in march when more information is available we ll be sure to sound off season of the forge vital

still working their way up to and beyond here is what we have planned to help you move more quickly up to prime engrams will now drop more frequently and with larger power bumps for players under

season of the forge as it continues scourge of the pasttomorrow the scourge of the past raid opens up to all of guardians who have the annual pass and are brave enough to venture into the last city to confront a new threat to its safety design lead brian frank is here to brief you one last time before the race for world first begins tomorrow brian the team could not be more excited for the scourge

before returning to orbit good luck guardians the first fireteam to defeat the raid will be crowned as world first and awarded with a raid belt as always they will be awarded to six teammates please

have someone in your fireteam grab the final chest and return to orbit immediately completing the activity is crossing the finish line you can read the full rules here good luck i am the crucibletoday we d like to address the feedback we ve received about the crucible the top issue reported by the community is associated with matchmaking in the competitive playlist many of you are expressing feedback around matching solos against fireteams matching high glory teams against lower glory teams and have many other suggestions regarding how progressing through the ranks should be changed the appropriate teams are investigating possible changes to be included in a future update we will have details for you as soon as we can we do have some information on changes to address another top trending issue in the crucible power ammo spawns there have been numerous requests to lower the amount of power ammo spawning in competitive games based on this feedback we will be lowering the amount of power ammo available during matches by increasing the time between power ammo spawns here are the details competitive controlinitial timers stay the sameincreased respawn timer for heavy ammo was

seconds now seconds rotators showdowninitial timers stay the sameincreased respawn timer for heavy ammo was seconds now seconds rumble initial timers stay the sameincreased respawn timer for heavy ammo was seconds now seconds it gets everywhere power ammo and matchmaking are not the only top-trending pieces of community feedback that we have been tracking many of you have sandbox-related questions that apply to pvp and pve there are vocal camps on both sides for a lot of these issues and our sandbox team is considering a combination of player feedback and data on the effectiveness of certain gear and abilities design lead john sandwich with notes on their process joe hello again my friends hamrick here to answer some hot community questions we have seen and give you a quick glimpse into what sandbox is working on for the rest of the year and on into while we have those hot questions coming right up i just wanted to take a second to call out something you may have noticed instead of building up to one or two massive patches a year we have transitioned to shipping smaller batches of changes much more frequently we hope that this new approach will allow us to remain more agile than we have been in the past and allow us to shake up the meta a bit on more frequent intervals we hope that a year from now we can all look back on this new way of working and agree that it was very successful alright enough of my rambling onward to the questions can you buff snipers we would really like flinch to be reduced and to have more lower zoom scopes snipers are definitely one of the archetypes we are actively looking at and making changes to for example later in january rapid-fire snipers will be moving to a two-shot body kill additionally we are considering allowing more snipers to be able to one-shot supers on headshots in a future patch lower zoom scopes do exist in the game but have not been particularly prevalent with post-forsaken weapons and have been largely limited to a few weapons ie the supremacy but we ll be increasing the number of them in the game as we move forward we don t currently have plans to alter sniper flinch any more at this time but we will continue to keep an eye on your feedback nova warp yup the nova warp super is too dominant right now and we are planning to tweak it it s currently slated to land with a patch coming in late january spectral blades hit detection feels much more consistent can sentinel and other melees get the same treatment we definitely want all melee supers to feel as good and reliable as possible this is something we are still looking into a lot of the pre-forsaken subclasses feel underpowered now can they get buffed yes we have some planned buffs coming to older subclass paths in the patch currently slated for late january but we are already looking ahead to what we d like to do in patches further down the line we will be regularly looking into tuning subclass content to ensure that there s a healthy balance of viable choices in all activities we use a combination of data and community feedback to track the right things to fix so please continue to surface which choices feel the least viable to help guide us any changes to the top exotics being used in the crucible like one eyed mask shards of galanor etc these exotics get talked about quite a bit and while i don t have any immediate incoming changes to share i expect that they will be getting looked at in the future telesto is currently besto can you tone it down or move it to the power slot late in january you will find that telesto s bolts-to-kill will now match its charge rate where it was previously doing more damage than other fusion rifles of its type that said due to it being affected less by damage falloff due to its explosive nature it will still be more consistent than fusion rifles of the same charge rate worth noting pve damage will be increased to keep parity there once we see how these changes land we can decide if and what to do next the goal still being to buff where we can but when we have to nerf you re going to find us trying to inch down instead of going nuclear at least as much as we can scouts rifles still feel weak in both pvp and pve can they come up this is another archetype we are looking at and i would currently expect to see changes show up in future patches could smgs get a non-precision damage buff we just recently buffed the range on smg s to make them more competitive we ll be monitoring the data and feedback for a bit to help us decided where to take them next if we find that they still aren t good enough we will be happy to buff them further can fusion rifles get buffed maybe longer range or higher damage to combat shotguns this is another archetype we are looking at and i would currently expect to see changes show up in future patches we did bring up the damage of rapid fire fusion rifles in last week any plans to adjust wavesplitter it s not at the top of our list but we do intend to take a look at it first we want to look at the global ammo economy for trace rifles in pvp and then we can take a look at wavesplitter s effectiveness titan skating is rampant on pc do you plan to remove it we d like to fix this however we re being careful about how we do so because it s so closely tied to the core feel of the lift ability in other words we don t want a titan skating fix to change the way the lift ability feels for all players we d love to have a simple fix to this issue we could roll out immediately but this one is going to take us a while to land on something solid to recap we want to roll out smaller batches of patches more frequently we want to bring things up whenever possible but when we do need to bring something down we are going to try and inch it down and into the correct location and finally there is a patch coming currently slated for late january where we expect you to see some changes coming to things like rapid-fire snipers telesto nova warp and pre-forsaken subclasses and we have much more planned for the months ahead love you always hamrickthat s the way the cookie crumbles this

       " Document(page_content=\"this week at bungie we give thanks our weekly check-in is coming at you a day early to make way for the holiday break tomorrow we ll be out of the studio in celebration of thanksgiving we ll be seated with family and friends the table will be set with a bountiful feast in the background a parade will march past on our televisions as each of us gives thanks for the good things in our lives we ll reflect on how fortunate we are to create entertainment for this amazing community destiny is an adventure that evolves year after year and we ve been honored and humbled that you ve come along with us on that journey in the spirit of the american holiday we will also be pardoning one of our fine feathered friends the colonel we know she is not a turkey but we wanted to make sure that whatever bird she may be she remains off the menu whatever you find yourself doing over the next few days whether it s seeing family or binging some destiny we wish you the best pinnacle weaponryseason of the forge is kicking off next week with it comes a new pinnacle weapon to earn in the crucible we received a lot of feedback that you also wanted a pinnacle weapon to work toward when pitted against the environment good news we have two for you vanguard strike missions and gambit are being added to the list of worthy pursuits with coveted trophies to be claimed they won t take as much of a time commitment as the crucible reward does but they will still require some dedication to their activities we asked sandbox designer victor anderson to give you the full rundown on all three pinnacle weapons for season victor we have heard your feedback and requests for weapons akin to luna s howl to earn in non-crucible activities like gambit and to meet that demand we've created three pinnacle weapons i do hope you ll enjoy them vanguardloaded question high-impact fusion rifle arc loaded question s unique perk is reservoir burst when the battery is full your next burst deals additional damage and causes enemies to explode on death this one went through a couple of cycles originally it had a completely different perk that didn t quite make the cut we tried a version that had only a damage bonus but damage bonuses can sometimes be hard to appreciate when you re using a special weapon against lower-health enemies so explosions on kill were added to really sell the oomph and deal with waves of clustered enemies how to earn loaded question pick up the quest from zavalacomplete all the following objectives you can earn progress toward these goals at the same time fusion rifle kills in any strike or nightfall arc kills in any strike or nightfall strike or nightfall completionshead back to zavala to receive a fully masterworked loaded questiongambitbreakneck precision auto rifle kinetic breakneck s unique perk is onslaught this weapon s rate of fire increases as you stack rampage when the plan was made to create more pinnacle weapons for a variety of activities and not just the crucible we had to think of something that would fit the activity this was intended to be a workhorse for gambit encounters where killing large numbers of enemies very fast is the name of the game for a significant portion of it so something with rampage was an obvious starting point pinnacle weapons occupy an interesting space in the sandbox where we can take what is normally a legendary-tier effect like rampage and expand on that idea further we did it with outlaw for desperado and we re doing something similar here for rampage how to earn breakneck pick up the quest from the driftercomplete all the following objectives you can earn progress toward these goals at the same time auto rifle kills auto rifle multikills challenging enemies defeated gambit matches completedcomplete all of the objectives and head back to the drifter to receive a fully masterworked breakneckcruciblethe mountaintop lightweight grenade launcher kinetic the mountaintop s unique perk is micro-missile this weapon fires in a straight line and has a massively increased projectile speed in addition to the above benefits the projectile instantly detonates on the environment instead of bouncing like a traditional grenade launcher unless you have sticky grenades selected this weapon was created for a few reasons other than the militia s birthright we haven t created any new lightweight grenade launchers since forsaken in general it s a pretty underrepresented weapon type this gave us an opportunity to explore it as a pinnacle crucible weapon and add more variety to the mix of what you ll use and have used against you the feeling of getting a direct hit for that instant kill is satisfying so the weapon was built to support it but to give it more options it s also the only lightweight grenade launcher with sticky grenades for those of you who have a more tactical approach to the crucible how to earn the mountaintop the quest to earn this weapon lives up to the weapon s name it s going to take some dedication we did change it up this season so you can do some of the steps in a non-competitive playlist if you chose but you will progress quicker by playing in the competitive playlist you still need to rank up your glory score to fabled in the end to claim the weapon step reach glory rank brave within a seasonstep each objective earns you progress per action in any playlist and players can earn substantial bonus progress by completing these objectives in the competitive playlist in the crucible

return to lord shaxx to receive the mountaintop we got a lot of feedback from players that they didn t like splitting their progress toward the crucible pinnacle quest all these objectives use account wide constructs so players can complete these objectives on any character that should give you an idea of how pinnacle weapons will work in season of the forge next week you can start earning them and

you continue to fight the scorn and defend the dreaming city we re collecting player feedback and looking at ways to improve your quality of life we have a few deployments in development and wanted to give you a preview of what s on the way everything below is subject to changes on the development floor if issues are found or bugs arise items may be delayed in any case we ll keep you updated on the status until this work is translated into patch notes performanceengineer ben thompson we have been paying close attention to reports of long load times on console and are working on improvements to reduce these load times let s break down three distinct performance issues that we are looking into each with different contributing factors starting up the game signing on and selecting your characterloading into activities and traveling throughout a destinationloading the player inventory screen and switching between ui tabsin the upcoming season update you should see significant improvements loading into activities and traveling throughout a destination we've been bringing new content bug fixes and patches at a cadence more frequent than we had previously accounted for that cadence of patching has translated into some unexpected overhead within the code that is responsible for loading data into the game all that being said loading from orbit into the edz should be reduced from over two minutes down to just over one minute and we re eager to see how things pan out in the wild we re continuing to investigate load times when launching destiny and when interacting with aspects of the ui when more information is available we ll provide updates super tuningsandbox design claude jerome spectral blades was heavily re-tuned to increase the reliability of melee attacks in pvp and to bolster the effectiveness of super s stealth capabilities the following changes are planned to reach these goals increasing melee lunge range of all attacksreducing the cost of light melee attacksincreasing the number of consecutive hits required to speed up attack ratedecreasing base attack speed to improve hit registration on intended targetsdeveloper commentary this is not intended as a nerf the goal here is to increase the intentionality of the attack rate increase so that it is most often happening when players are focusing on a single targetretuned melee targeting to have greater emphasis on player input i e where your stick input is directed toward or which target your camera is facing developer commentary the goal here is to reduce the likelihood of melee targeting picking enemies that you don t want to hitincreasing viability of stealth mechanicsadded a small amount of damage resistance to the stealth statefurther decrease to super drain when in stealth statefor chaos reach we re tuning the energy cost of deactivating chaos reach early the intent of this tuning pass is to make it more rewarding to skillfully time your early deactivation when using this super essentially it will be more punishing to deactivate the chaos reach super extremely early but less punishing when deactivating later in the super checkpoint resetsuser interface

added but wanted to note that the feedback is under investigation gambit free trial and double infamy weekend recently destiny became free to all players on pc through november to celebrate our new

next three weeks she will unleash you in pursuit of those who killed master ives the less-hated of the cryptarchs each week offers up a new step in the quest along with a powerful reward happy hunting getting granular with masterwork armor there have been some questions on how damage resistance works when masterworking armor in an effort to better explain some mechanics in the game where tooltips fall short we are going to dive into some specifics to explain the maths that goes into protecting your guardian from incoming arc barrages sandbox tester ryan hammond will approach the chalkboard ryan hello everyone here is a brief rundown on how masterworking your armor increases your damage resistance from both all incoming elemental damage from combatants and all damage during your super masterwork armor breakdown three families of masterwork perks arc solar and voideach family of perks has five tierseach legendary armor item has a masterwork perk randomly assigned allowing each player to potentially build up cumulative tiers of masterworks for a given damage typeeach tier bestows the following effects damage resistance against any combatant attack carrying the specified damage type not player attacks damage resistance against any attack while the guardian is in supersuper damage resistance stacks regardless of family disparity for example if a player has tier arc and tier void they have a cumulative additional damage resistance while in super but only damage resistance vs arc combatant damage and vs void combatant damagethe in-super damage resistance stacks multiplicatively with the innate damage resistance of a superkeep in mind that while your masterwork super damage resistance stacks with the base damage resistance of your supers you will never be invulnerable to attacks lastly differences in power levels between the guardian and combatants no matter how minor it may seem play a large role in determining incoming damage with damage resistances modifying that damage further i hope this helps explain a little better what is going on under the hood when we see you asking the unanswered questions we ll continue to use this space to seek out the

cayde- met his doom in the depths of the prison of elders we ve shared a journey through the discoveries in forsaken week after the week the community conversation has been dominated by the revelation of new secrets and challenges some of you have lamented the fact that s it s been hard to keep up but all of these things still await you now is a good time for each guardian to take stock of what they ve accomplished what fights are next on their dance card or what they d most like to add to their collections we ve asked the question about triumphs god rolls gear sets and even titles there is still a lot to accomplish in forsaken plenty left to earn and learn you might have to speed right past some of these accolades or rewards in your rush to become raid ready we have some more tricks up our sleeves to keep your guardian lifestyle rich and exciting and those conversations will begin soon in the meantime there are still some questions we d like to answer about how the day-to-day experience will be changing with the next round of updates let s dig in and set some expectations gambit and the malfeasance questthe following changes are currently in development for destiny update planned for october if any issues are found in the course of that work changes may be delayed or tweaked accordingly make sure to stay tuned for future updates without further ado here s what you need to know coming directly from the gambit team malfeasance acquisition we ve heard player feedback concerning the spawn rates of the ascendant primeval servitor and we are making adjustments to how frequently it will appear during week three of the curse cycle also known as a full-curse week the ascendant primeval servitor will have almost the same chance to spawn as any other primeval we will also be increasing the chance for the boss to spawn during lesser-curse weeks but it will still be lower than during a full-curse week for full transparency since the ascendant primeval servitor spawn rate will increase significantly when these changes are released we are tweaking how ship and sparrow rewards drop from the boss vanity items are no longer guaranteed drops for subsequent boss kills after you earn the quest instead the vanity items will now only have a chance to drop quitter protection we are currently developing a change to gambit matchmaking that will help with the extended load times some players have been experiencing when this change is released we will be re-enabling quitter penalties for the gambit playlist however we have increased the number of games players can leave before they are restricted from the playlist we are making this change to help mitigate some situations where bad internet connectivity results in a restriction power ammo crate changes to help balance some weapons we re changing the amount of ammo that you will receive when opening an ammo crate with certain weapons equipped sleeper simulant ammo crate will grant two shots down from four swords ammo crate will grant sword ammo up from six the gambit team is closely monitoring community feedback and looking at game data in future updates you should expect changes to gambit bounties how frequently you earn rewards and other changes to the mode that will give teams in the lead a greater advantage we ll be back in future weeks to shed more light on the future of gambit as it continues to evolve the gambit teamupdate calendarlast year we used roadmaps to telegraph how destiny was going to evolve in the months to come our plans for the seasons and the annual pass are the items worth

destiny content release right about now you might be wondering when another version of the raid will rear its ugly head full of eyes and teeth approaching forsaken the raid team had specific goals in mind for last wish and how players would engage with the content as we hope you have noticed our goals for this expansion have been very different all year long we ve been working behind the scenes to reinvent the way a story campaign feeds into a lasting hobby we set out to change everything from the way you collect gear to the way you tackle the endgame with the goals to create a more varied and rewarding experience across the endgame of destiny laid out before us we had to make a series of difficult choices one of these choices was that we would not be creating multiple difficulties of last wish instead forsaken would focus on making sure the single difficulty mode of last wish was highly rewarding and that there were plenty of unique activities to participate in for great rewards across the entire endgame once this decision was made we focused on creating one definitive version of last wish with no qualifiers attached to it we wanted to create an experience that offered the truest forms of every encounter from day one and offered some of the most powerful rewards in the game to anyone who could succeed watching your reactions to last wish has been one the highlights of the raid team s career and we can t wait to see how you fare this december in the black armory s brand new raid lair if you re holding an annual pass look for more about the next lair we re creating for a raider such as yourself real soon first though there are other events to observe lost and found welcome to october this month will be home to another festival of the lost it begins on october with a

where players surpass its bonus threshold their nightfall rank will increment upward by one whole point for players to achieve the maximum nightfall rank of and make zavala s tier- masterwork toil and trouble available for purchase players will need to surpass the point bonus threshold in all nightfall strikes in addition to nightfall ranks commander zavala also oversees the vanguard ranks this

caused by bounties expiring while they are left in a given character s postmaster while we are working to resolve this issue for characters who are already affected players can proactively take mitigation steps by ensuring that no bounties are left in the postmaster before logging out of a play session it s critical to note that character data is not at risk due to this occurrence and all characters are expected to be intact once this issue is resolved for information on a fix as soon as it is available players should keep an eye on our updates page destiny forsaken known issuesin

       " Document(page_content=\"this week at bungie the dreaming city revealed its underworld the curse on the dreaming city has grown to its most potent state as the curse grows stronger the world changes with it some of you discovered a new portal and dove into the shattered throne to attack the heart of the curse you still have until the reset to give it a try it s an endgame activity that puts your most powerful gear and skills to the test if you are not quite ready yet don t worry the shattered throne will return when the curse cycle is at its worst again in three weeks that should give you some time to power up and prepare to explore its depths that s not the only new activity that became available this week we also released a new crucible mode along with new maps to boot if you have been too busy with the plethora of other options available on the director here is a quick look at the mode and maps available now for all players of destiny uncommon coresever since forsaken launched we have received tons of feedback on a wide variety of topics two issues seem to stand above the rest the cost of masterwork cores and the drop rate of exotic weapons and armor we asked the investment team to talk about some of our goals with masterwork cores and exotic drop rates the problems we ve identified and our plans for addressing them investment team we have been monitoring the community s feedback concerning masterwork cores and exotic drop rates here is a quick breakdown of our original design goals along with some of our plans to address your feedback masterwork cores for infusiongoals for adding masterwork cores to infusion costsmake infusing and masterworking a meaningful choice infusion and masterwork should not be mutually exclusive problems with the current masterwork core economymasterwork cores have a misleading name when they were created the definition of a pinnacle item put the emphasis almost entirely on masterworking we expanded that definition in forsaken but didn t update the currency there are not enough reliable sources to earn masterwork cores which can make deciding what to spend them on too difficult plans for addressing those problemswe have been monitoring core supplies and the numbers aren t as high as we d like we are planning to create more reliable and plentiful core sources we are going to rename masterwork cores so their purpose is more obvious exotic drop ratesgoals for exotic drop ratesexotics are intended to be meaningful long-term chases finding an exotic should be rare but impactful problems with the current exotic drop ratesright now we are falling short of the impactful part of our goal there s nothing exciting or powerful about getting your fourth fighting lion when all you really want is a two-tailed fox plans for addressing those problemswe plan to increase the chance for exotics to drop something you don t already have we ll continue to monitor your feedback and will give you more details about these changes before they go live on the next iron banner last week lord saladin returned to the tower for the first time since the launch of forsaken he brought with him a few changes to iron banner and we ve been monitoring the community s reaction to them senior designer jeremiah pieschl has some information about our plans for the next iron banner jeremiah one of the goals we have for iron banner is that it s an opportunity for lower-power players to catch up or reengage in their pursuit of power based on your feedback and our analytics we re not meeting that goal there are two changes we re making to help resolve this problem the first change is to reduce the completion values for several of the event bounties currently it s very difficult for a lower-power player to complete the bounties due to the gameplay disadvantages they experience lightbearer super kills has been reduced to from iron in the blood match completions has been reduced to from shine on orbs generated has been reduced to from iron victory match wins has been reduced to from to be precise precision kills has been reduced to from all in a week s work kills has been reduced to from the second change is that all bounties will now provide powerful gear this was the first iron banner in destiny in which power was enabled we have seen feedback from players who enjoyed this and feedback from players who preferred it when power was normalized we will continue to monitor the conversation but wanted to give you some information on exactly how power affects your damage compared to previous iron banner events in d pvp lead derek carroll has the details along with some graphs derek there s a lot to unpack here hey so you might be interested in what power matters actually means going forward in iron banner in the past we ve published a nice-but-not-exactly-straightforward graph pulled straight from the game s content this time around is no different although i will take a bit of time to explain what that purple line means to you the player as you read left-to-right across the graph you re seeing the effects of having power that amount lower than the player you re attacking for example if i m at the same level as my opponent my outgoing damage is multiplied by so there is no change from normal crucible if i m power below my opponent my outgoing damage is multiplied by or a reduction if i m power below my opponent my outgoing damage is multiplied by or a reduction and i am really sad about what s happening to me in this match oh one more thing this curve also works the other way if you re power above your opponent for example you will do a bonus damage against them and so on down the curve i hope this explanation helps you to anticipate what is happening out there in the field where numbers and bullets are flying around all of these changes should be available for the next iron banner and we will continue to monitor your feedback during the next event that wizard came from high

improving their toolsets to watch over destiny they have some important information to share on how we re improving your search for glory in the competitive playlist security team throughout season we ve been working on improvements to our systems that identify players who may be tampering with their connection to crucible matches or breaking the terms of service for destiny we have some news to share but first a point of clarification we have received reports from players who have been using bungie net or other third-party websites to attempt to identify wrongdoers we want to clarify that our internal tools have much more detail which players do not have access to for example a player who returns to orbit or switches their character will show as did not finish on a third-party website while our internal tools have much more detail on the reason they left the match this helps to ensure that we do not hand out restrictions when opponents are disconnecting due to temporary networking or isp issues or opponents leaving of their own accord using this data and working with the pvp team directly we ve recently updated our detection and analysis tools and re-checked the previous four months of matches from the competitive playlist effective september we will apply more restrictions and bans to player accounts that benefitted from opponent disconnects at a highly abnormal frequency throughout season with our improved detection methods this will include voluntary disconnects when players are repeatedly matching against the same opponents we are also updating our account restrictions and banning policies to detail the potential forms of punishment depending on the severity of infractions players may receive crucible restrictions and bans this will remove access to pinnacle crucible rewards such as redrix s claymore redrix s broadsword and luna s howl and any pinnacle crucible rewards released in the future for the most severe infractions players may permanently lose access to all destiny activities including pve as we begin to apply this moderation we will be crosschecking matches to ensure the proper levels of punishment are applied we ll continue to apply and revise our detections throughout season and beyond if you believe you ve encountered a player who is breaking the terms of service please see report suspected cheating on help bungie net this page details all available forms of reporting to bungie for the platform on which you play as a final note thanks to everyone who plays destiny legitimately we appreciate the time you invest in our game and we re working hard to ensure everyone has a good experience when rightly earning their rewards pardon our dustsince the year deployment on tuesday we ve seen reports that matchmaking time in the crucible may be taking longer than usual while no deliberate changes to matchmaking were deployed in update we have been investigating this issue we are planning to deploy a fix that we hope will increase the speed of matchmaking queues as our investigation continues please stay tuned to bungiehelp for updates on our progress upon the launch of forsaken skill matching will work in the same manner it has in recent weeks i e no skill-based matchmaking in the near future we will preview any planned improvements to matchmaking in crucible labs first so we can tune that experience collaboratively as always our commitment remains to communicate all changes to the competitive ecosystem in advance right here on bungie net thanks for playing download after download as we said last

and all players will continue to earn xp and bright engrams at their expected rates this issue is expected to be resolved on september with hotfix we are currently investigating an issue that causes the precision multiplier for some weapons with explosive rounds to be incorrectly capped making them deal less total damage than intended we are investigating reports of issues impacting sandbox gameplay including hand cannon recoil on pc and aiming down sights not cancelling properly some year forsaken weapons and armor may drop prematurely from world loot sources items awarded to players early may see minor changes following hotfix and the launch of destiny forsaken on september some objectives that require heroic strikes will not be achievable until hotfix on september players who

year limits as with all increases to player power in destiny players should be aware that infusing gear with a requirement above their current character level will make the infusion recipient

       " Document(page_content=\"this week at bungie we witnessed a gunslinger s last stand earlier today we showed you another glimpse of cayde- surrounded by barons fighting off a barrage of enemies take a look you will be able to experience the full story of cayde s fate and claim your revenge when forsaken launches on september that wasn t the only thing we showed off on the blizzard stage at gamescom we also announced an upcoming -hour gambit trial that is free to all players of destiny if you want to give gambit a try before forsaken the competitive co-op activity will be on full display september gambit -hour trialbegins am pdt september ends am pdt september you will have to wait until after september to start earning gambit-specific rewards and ranking up your infamy but you will still see some year reward drops gambit stats will not be recorded during the -hour trial but they will be available for tracking on bungie net after september about that timemany of you have been reaching out with questions about start times and dates you want to know the exact time you will be able to start hunting down uldren and his barons and then when you can turn your might toward whatever horrors await you within the raid on september there will be a day one patch that players will need to download before they can play forsaken destiny will be brought down for maintenance at am pdt and we anticipate that the patch will become available to players on all platforms by am pdt maintenance will end at am pdt and assuming you have completed your download you can start playing forsaken at that time the next date we know you want to circle on your calendar is when the raid will open up and when the race for world first will begin here is senior designer joe blackburn to tell you more joe forsaken is proof that the full destiny experience is just beginning when the campaign comes to a close with so many new things to do and so much power to gain we knew that players would need more than just three days to prepare for the incredible challenges of forsaken s raid that s why last wish the next chapter in destiny s raiding legacy goes live on september at am pdt a week and a half after you ll have first set foot on the tangled shore good luck guardians mod squadthere has been some confusion about the new mods coming on september many of you are asking what gear will take mods and what will happen to the old mods when the new hotness arrives we brought in design lead joe shamrock to answer these questions ham slamrick hey everybody i m back on this beautiful twab before the twab before if you catch my meaning to paint you a clearer picture regarding year mods the first thing we need to do is to properly set expectations for the acquisition of year mods we want mods to be more meaningful customizations to your gear that allow you to make it your own as you ve likely seen from the combat stream we ve added several options that will let you adapt your arsenal to your style of play although the stream showcased a huge stockpile of mods when you can t give yourself an unlimited number of mods using a debug build you ll find these items are intentionally rare those of you who are smaugly sitting atop a pile of mod components will be able to stock up on some year mods from the gunsmith the rest of us however will slowly mod our way to victory one hard-earned drop after another specifically year mods come from the following sources all exotic armor drops regardless of year have a chance to come equipped with a mod non-raid year legendary weapons and armor drops have a small chance to come equipped with a mod you are free to keep the weapon should that particular weapon-and-mod combo suit your needs or you may choose to dismantle the weapon to break out the mod for use elsewhere you may pull mods out of gear for use in other gear by dismantling the original item they dropped in alternatively should you want the item but not the mod you can choose to slot in a new mod over the old one weapons and armor purchased from vendors do not come with mods if you have the mod components and glimmer necessary to feed your habit you may choose to go straight to banshee- the gunsmith who will have two mod packages available for purchase direct-buy year armor mod updated daily direct-buy year weapon mod updated daily you may acquire mod components for trading with banshee- by dismantling other loose mods armor year armor mods always drop one mod component when dismantled year legendary armor mods always drop one mod component when dismantled year rare armor mods have a small chance of dropping one mod component when dismantled weapons year weapon mods always drop one mod component and legendary shards when dismantled year legendary weapon mods always drop one mod component and gunsmith materials when dismantled year rare weapon mods have a small chance to drop one mod component and gunsmith materials when dismantled finally this one goes out to the year armor mods and the year armor that loves them as of the launch of forsaken on september year armor mods in your inventory will cease to work but can be dismantled or traded for materials year armor mods currently slotted into your year armor will cease to work but remain slotted into the armor see below year armor mods will be able to be slotted into both year and year armor mod slots and that s the deal with mods ham i m gon be invading your gambit games real real quick like rickpatch notes sneak peeknext tuesday a lot of changes go into effect we have

       " Document(page_content=\"this week at bungie we demonstrated the evolution of combat in the second year of destiny during an action-packed livestream we showed off the changes that all players can expect including our new weapon slot system random rolls more meaningful weapon mods and a decreased time to kill in the crucible crispy three taps and spicy devils all destiny players can experience a preview of our sandbox updates on august one topic that we ve seen a lot of questions about is how we ll migrate from old weapon mods to new weapon mods starting on august your current mods will be deprecated and your inventory will tell you that you can safely discard them for materials and parts on september the gunsmith s inventory will be dedicated to new forsaken mods between now and the preload on august use your year mods to lock in the elemental damage type you want for your year weapons they will retain that damage type after the mod deprecation on august the old mod slot will go away and you will no longer be able to insert any mods into year gear or change the elemental damage type some weapons will be moving to the kinetic slot and will not retain elemental damage regardless of what mod you had applied the ikelos sniper rifle and shotgun will be locked to solar here are the legendary weapons that will be moving to kinetic baligantshepherd s watchhawthorne s field-forged shotgunalone as a godperfect paradoxthe frigid jackalsilicon neuromathere is plenty that s about to change right now is a good time for us to set your expectations about a lot of it this is a big one let s dig in wide awake and dreamingfar away from the crucible you ll find the first dedicated endgame destination we ve created home to our largest endgame experience ever you ll discover the dreaming city in destiny forsaken how to become legend in year weapon tuning and systems aren t the only things that are changing in forsaken when your next journey begins you ll also discover new ways to earn rewards and become more powerful the investment team can give you a sense for what s coming investment team here are our high-level goals for progression and economy in season we want to bring back the days when you are impressed when you see someone at max power in the tower the experience of leveling and then powering up should be meaningful players should have a sense of discovery when earning rewards from different activities when players accomplish something difficult the rewards should be special or unique not all of the sources of power in a week should be apparent on the director acquisition of powerin year an activity such as the raid would have an absolute range of power that it could generate rewards would grant only a small difference in power level even if you were overcoming the challenge while under-leveled in forsaken we are scaling the power production of all content by the difficulty of that content if you manage to beat the raid while power under the recommended level you should expect to receive more potent rewards when players earn powerful rewards these items should never scale down to where they do not give an increase in power even if your power is over an activity s recommended level it should still grant a reward at least one power level above your current average this means that players should still benefit when grouping with teammates who haven t accomplished as much as they have we ve also created multiple new sources of power for powerful rewards that refresh on a different cadence than the weekly reset the goal is to provide more to do for the players who want to play a variety of activities that said not every reward you find in the wild will be a powerful upgrade we don t want to spoil the entire journey to max power so we ll be leaving it in the hands of the players to discover the best ways to reach endgame and beyond when forsaken is released as a final note on power we ve heard a lot of feedback concerning exotics to make these rewards feel more useful whenever you receive an exotic reward in forsaken it will always be at or above your guardian s power milestonesthe milestone tray has been revamped in forsaken and will now specifically show the most important nonrepeatable quests for every player of destiny the campaign quests are a good example of this meanwhile our world quests for destinations will now live in the pursuits section of your character inventory many milestones from year have been converted to activity challenges these will continue to grant powerful rewards but they will no longer be displayed in the milestone tray when you access the director you ll see activity challenges in the tooltip of the associated activity activitiesthe base strike playlist for destiny forsaken players has been updated to feature difficulty selection and modifiers heroic strikes are being retired on august with destiny update forsaken playersthe strike playlist has three difficulties to select from power power power once you re power over a given playlist it will no longer appear as an option for you to select this ensures a healthy matchmaking pool when players reach endgame power levels the power playlist will always available strikes will have modifiers legacy playersthe strike playlist matches the legacy playlist that is currently available in year recommended power strikes will have modifiers between august and september modifiers will be unavailable for all strike playlists the nightfall activity is also being revisited for season prestige difficulty is being retired but the base difficulty for the nightfall activity will increase additionally players will have the ability to choose one of three nightfall strikes each week if there s a specific nightfall unique reward that a given player is hunting for this reduces the time they have to wait for the strike to be featured again while having three options players may only select the strikes for which they own the appropriate expansions legacy players will still be able to enable modifiers via their challenge card scoring will not be available for legacy players in the power nightfall meditations are being retired and replaced with a heroic story playlist new campaign missions will be featured at power while old campaign missions will be set to a power level relative to their release this ensures legacy players can still enjoy story activities at their leisure ikora rey s vanguard research reputation tokens will no longer be used as a currency after august and will be removed from player inventories the legendary parade gear will also no longer be available so if you want it get it before august heroic adventures are being added to all destinations when that destination is the flashpoint one adventure will be selected to be heroic per day with the exceptions of mercury and mars those two destinations will function as they currently do but they will gain an additional adventure per day when they're the featured flashpoint players will no longer be able to purchase normal adventure tokens from vendors on destinations other than mercury and mars activity modifiers will be shared across heroic adventures heroic story missions and strikes this ensures that each day you know what to expect from the pve content that you play as a ritual and that when we balance and tune modifiers it s happening across the game this will include one weekly singe one daily buff and one daily debuff the brawler and grenadier modifiers will have their recharge times adjusted to ensure they re noticeable adjusting your equipment for either also has a rather significant impact we ve seen some pretty crazy plays by the new solar hunter in our playtest some experienced players out there may be reminded of the feelings found when they equipped nothing manacles in the past economy updatesfor the last few weeks we ve seen a lot of players asking about items and currencies available in year and whether they ll continue to be available in year or not expect the following changes on august when destiny update becomes available destination materials will become your main source of reputation on their respective destinations destination materials will be a part of the cost to infuse different weapons and armor across your arsenal year challenges that granted reputation tokens are being retired but will be replaced by bounties offered on each destination that provide destination materials destination tokens and rare destination materials are no longer awarded but you can still redeem them for reputation if you have them in your inventory anything that previously granted destination tokens or rare materials will reward common destination materials moving forward the gunsmith will also be updated in season in year this vendor required gunsmith materials for one reputation package this will increase to gunsmith materials iron banner vanguard and crucible tokens earned in season may be redeemed at their respective vendors in season trials of the nine will be on hiatus during season and its reputation tokens will not be redeemable at this time we have not yet determined whether its currency will be used when it returns it s lit fam lord saladin makes his final appearance in season next week this will be your last chance to earn your season rewards begins tuesday august ends tuesday august the game as always is control there are a few changes to the iron banner control you know and love iron temple fire pits have replaced the usual control flags there is also a new power play rule where capturing all three zones will lock them down for seconds at the end of the power play all the zones are reset to neutral and must be recaptured power enabledstarting in season iron banner will be updated to enable power level advantages like in the days of old all players of destiny regardless of expansion ownership can participate in iron banner events year rewards featuring random rolls and compatibility with year modifications will also be available to all players players who acquire new power during their adventures in forsaken will have an advantage but we don t want to exclude anyone who wants to compete in iron banner and reap the rewards iron banner rewards will be capped for legacy players at their maximum power available trials of the nine will be unavailable for the duration of season the design team is putting it back on the workbench to make it a fitting challenge for the hardcore warrior when the weekly activity returns it will feature updated rewards power advantages and other gameplay changes the final weekend of season trials of the nine will take place on the weekend of august we ll tell you more about our goals and our progress during season faction farewell in season we introduced some changes notably the renown mechanic to faction rallies the community responded with a lot of great feedback about how we could continue to improve the experience the feedback ranged in topic from experience to rewards but many of you expressed the following i don t want to feel forced to participate in every instance of the event each seasonmake the event progression a bit less hardcore and more engagingwe plan to take that feedback and use it to improve activities and events in the future when season begins faction rallies will be on hiatus this will give us a good opportunity to focus on some other areas of the game that need attention and reevaluate some of the fundamental aspects of the event while the faction rallies event is on hiatus faction tokens will not be redeemable we ll tell you more about their fate in the future for players who were unable to acquire specific exotic weapon catalysts during previous faction rallies we are working on new ways for you to earn them they will not be available at the beginning of season but we will provide more

weldon has the details about what mode will be played in the next crucible labs andrew hello again hopefully you re all having an excellent solstice of heroes i ve been going scorched-earth with my dawnblade in my quest for yet another destiny t-shirt for the collection but even in the midst of the celebration the science must continue thank you to all of you who played lockdown in labs we saw a very positive feedback trend for the mode overall but we also received some good feedback on areas to explore for improvement we ll be examining that feedback as we continue to close down forsaken and we ll provide updates in the future as we have them speaking of updates in our first twab post discussing the crucible labs debut i spoke about how we started fairly simple with the mode showdown we met our goals for the rollout but as noted the reception of showdown itself was fairly mixed iteration is a critical phase of development and we ve taken some time to iterate a bit on showdown based on notes we gathered both internally and externally from all of you here s the set of changes we ve made for this next iteration the round time limit has been reduced to secondsrounds now have a score limit of revives are now enabledreviving a teammate before they respawn will take the point back from your opponentswhether you played showdown in the first labs or this will be your first time in the playlist we hope you ll drop in for a few matches and let us know what you think hit up the feedback forum with your thoughts after you ve played as with lockdown labs will continue to drop standard crucible rewards and contribute to your valor rating so your time spent here will also count if you re working through your ranks for the triumphs and armor and of course you can play the new showdown right now valor for allif you ve been working on your solstice armor you may notice a few objectives tied to the crucible once you reach legendary-tiered armor your final crucible objective is to have your valor rank reset at some point since crucible ranks were implemented leading up to the beginning of year you ll see multiple opportunities to earn valor points at an accelerated rate including a special triple valor iron banner weekend mark your calendars appropriately double valor weekstart am pdt on august end am pdt on august triple valor weekendstart am pdt on august end am pdt on august

celebration not only is the team ready to provide troubleshooting steps but they also have some helpful tips for guardians looking to maximize their orb generation this is their report elemental orb generationsolstice of heroes is now live in destiny included with this event are elemental alignments which allows players to generate and stack elemental orbs to increase their damage output with the matching element for a short time additionally players must collect arc solar and void orbs in various activities to complete objectives attached to their solstice armor set while these orbs are generated randomly by defeating enemies here are a few tips on how you can make sure you re generating the orbs of a desired element orbs are generated only by players who have an entire solstice armor set equipped of any quality elemental orb generation does not require super ability kills or masterwork weapon kills players can potentially generate orbs on any kill as long as they are wearing their full solstice armor set elemental orbs are generated based off of the player s equipped subclass as well as their equipped energy and power weapons if for example you wanted to generate only solar orbs changing your loadout to all-solar helps you accomplish this kinetic weapons can also generate orbs based off of the player s loadout you can generate and receive elemental orbs from local allies if you re travelling in a fireteam coordinating elements can help you more aggressively progress through elemental orb pursuits be aware that the elemental alignments will expire when solstice of heroes concludes at the weekly reset on august from that point on players will no longer generate elemental orbs and will no longer be able to upgrade their solstice armor for more information

until the weekly reset on august today we showed off what some of the new weapons and armor can do in forsaken we love it when the game does the talking here is a glimpse of some of the tools of the trade that arrive with forsaken on september full stream aheadever since we started talking about the second year of destiny we ve dropped a lot of hints about how the state of combat between guardians will be changing we know you have questions about how you ll be using your weapons next season how will you equip them how will you customize them how will you earn the ammunition you ll need to use them some of these things defy explanation so we ll demonstrate the performance of the new arsenal in real time you are invited to watch us engage in combat for science year two combat reveal streamtuesday august am pdttwitch tv bungie or youtube com bungiejoining us again in one of the hot seats will be full-time senior sandbox designer and part-time rockstar jon weisnewski he makes some promises that we ll keep when we go live on stream newsk hello friends if you re a sharp-eyed pvp enthusiast you may have noticed from some forsaken coverage that the weapons are doing a bit more damage than they do in the current version of destiny if you re a seasoned destiny player you may then extrapolate the possibility of a global lethality pass on weapons and abilities that may or may not be in the pipe to go live when forsaken is released i m here to quickly confirm that along with weapon slots and ammo availability we have globally adjusted the time to kill in the crucible if you d like more details join us on stream and we ll get into it see you then and that s just one question we ll answer beyond the shadow of a doubt tune in for a full demonstration of perks mods loadouts and everything else you ll need to know to best your fellow players in battle we can t give you skill but we can equip you with a pre-mission briefing save the date follow our channels and prepare your favorite chat room snacks back to the lab again crucible labs has been on hiatus for a while it s time to start experimenting again senior designer andrew weldon has the details about the new mode coming next and when you can expect to see it go live andrew hello again back in may we launched the first crucible labs playlist with the game mode showdown as discussed in the following week s twab this was a good opportunity for us to test the playlist on a relatively safe baseline that we had mostly already shipped for crimson days and the standalone doubles playlist the first test served its purpose we stood the system up and got great feedback on an in-development mode we ve also made one noteworthy change to labs as a whole with the update labs matches will now also count toward your valor ranking and will offer standard crucible rewards at match complete now that we ve released that update we re ready to deploy our next crucible labs experiment to you lockdown lockdown is a new v round-based competitive mode that like control is about capturing and holding zones unlike control your only score comes from playing the objective those of you from the taken king rise of iron era know this mode s predecessor the control variant zone control here s how it plays out both teams start lockdown with a progress percentage of displayed under the scoreboard once a team holds two zones progress will begin ticking up for that team at a rate of per second there is no round timer the first team to reach will win the round and the first to win three rounds will win the match that s not all though if a team can successfully capture all three zones they will instantly win the round regardless of each team s progress state a well-coordinated push from your opponents will always be dangerous which means you need to stay focused on your objective however winning a round that way is not necessarily as simple as it might seem to earn capture progress or win on the triple cap you must hold uncontested zones if a team holds two zones you can fully halt their progress by contesting one or more zones you ll see progress halted display under the scoreboard to let you know this is happening they won t start earning score again until they clear you and your progress off the point s the same applies when going for the triple cap lockdown the instant win only applies if all three zones are completely clear we ve seen some really exciting matches play out from this ruleset internally and we hope you have similar experiences out in the wild as with any labs playlist this mode is not final and you may come across some tuning issues or bugs your most direct avenue for feedback on this mode will be in a new labs thread on the feedback forum and we ll be monitoring the conversation we see around the mode to pluck out actionable items for future iteration and polish we hope you enjoy this first look at the new mode and you can play it right now shhhhmany guardians have heard whispers on io and rushed to investigate some of you encountered a long streak of cabal drills far too many cabal drills we did some investigating to see if this was a bug turns out there s no bug but the current random generator doesn t do a good job of preventing streaks of either event we re currently investigating ways to prevent these bad luck runs in the future we did some simulations to see if there might be any more long streaks of one type of event in the forecast we expect a few more outliers but balanced with long streaks of only taken blight events this activity will be available every week and once you do unlock the heroic version it will stay unlocked we will continue to monitor the situation happy hunting from now until forsakenearlier this week we published a new development roadmap previous editions of this forecast were more focused on our plans for the future with our immediate future looking brighter even with a darker story to tell we re using the roadmap to telegraph the updates you ll need to download before your second year of destiny can begin we ve been pretty true to the plans we laid out in the last roadmap but there were some new entries as we do today we d like to provide some commentary on director updates and milestones and challenges updates two of the main functions of the director have been to help players know what to do next and lead them to sources of more powerful gear we have some new ideas for how we can better support these goals so we re changing the way those things work there will be three ways to acquire powerful engrams in forsaken a whole new challenge system that will replace the way you have been tracking milestones specific quests and bounties will provide better gear indicated by their summaries new mysteries are rarer sources but if we told you about them they wouldn t be mysterious most of these sources of power will be refreshed weekly or daily some will be one-time sources once these changes are deployed into the wild the milestones blade will call attention to these activities critical required missions such as the main campaign or new subclass path pursuitsnext steps for quests or other aspects of the progression of your characterslegacy milestones from destiny campaigns that aren t becoming challenges or questsadditionally the layout of the director will be updated to accommodate two new destinations the tangled shore and the dreaming city you ll obviously need to purchase forsaken to visit them but they ll appear on the interface that we all see today we wanted to set some expectations for what s changing and why it was on the roadmap you ll understand the full experience for how these new and improved features lead you on your journey to your maximum potential as a guardian when you play that s always the best source of understanding plus discovering the path is part of the fun save the datesthere are plenty more than just downloads that have to happen before forsaken launches with gambit as our special cargo we re heading to gamescom where we will make some important announcements we re going to pax west where we ll mix it up with the community and yes play some gambit one more time before launch as always there will be fun things happening in the game to keep you challenged and entertained as you count down the days until september check out our august calendar of events in the game and in real life the sacred texts a popular request among guardians is to see the grimoire committed to print today we are proud to announce an upcoming destiny grimoire anthology until now the myths mysteries and machinations of the destiny universe were found hidden throughout the worlds enticing threads that hinted at a greater tapestry the destiny grimoire anthology weaves tales from multiple sources together for the first time casting new light on destiny s most legendary heroes infamous villains and their greatest moments of triumph and tragedy each unique volume intends to illuminate a facet of the world and the complete anthology will confirm and challenge players thoughts and assumptions about what it means to be a guardian offering new and differing perspectives on the cosmic war that rages between the traveler and its ancient enemies the first volume is titled dark mirror and available for preorder on the bungie store look for it this fall wherever books are sold it will also be published in additional languages and available in additional regions to be announced service guarantees citizenship there are many ways we collaborate with our players to make a better game we pore over feedback loops from multiple sources on the internet we contract notable experts among you to join us as testers for a limited run sometimes we ll even host a summit in our studio to dig into our future plans those measures while effective unfortunately don t stand a chance of including everyone bungie user research

support became aware of an issue impacting the glory bonuses earned by players who were completing three or more competitive crucible matches a week with the launch of crucible ranks in season it was intended that players who were fabled rank or below would receive a bonus allocation of glory points following the weekly reset of any week during which they completed three or more competitive matches after investigating player reports regarding this feature we have determined these glory rank packages are not being granted as intended while we re working with our crucible team to investigate this issue players should expect that this issue will persist for the remainder of season players who are aiming to unlock glory rank based rewards for season should plan their crucible play accordingly for more information players should visit our seasonal crucible ranking help article destiny hotfix next week we re deploying destiny hotfix to players this hotfix is the final

in our immediate future bountiful harvest when you light out into the wild in search of action and adventure the fighting is all the sweeter when you have more ways to reap the rewards in update we re expanding on that experience with new bounties for destiny senior design lead tyson green who some suspect is actually the cryptarch in his spare time has some thoughts on what we want to accomplish with this addition to the player experience tyson with the original launch of destiny bounties provided a set of daily objectives that players could use to advance faction reputation or earn xp to level up their gear these were removed to streamline the activity experience in destiny and reduce the number of chores that players felt compelled to complete every day in retrospect we realized that was an over-correction and optional daily objectives to achieve specific goals are something we want to restore the bounties returning to destiny in update are a return to most of the properties of bounties in the taken king they will be obtained from a variety of vendors they will generally award xp and faction reputation though some will offer even better rewards and can be redeemed in the field to immediately claim your rewards in forsaken you may also see some bounties drop in the wild there are two new mechanics bounties will expire if left uncompleted and acquiring them will cost a small amount of glimmer we wanted to avoid the grab every bounty you see until your inventory is packed and sort them out later experience without constraining players to the tiny inventory they found in previous iterations of the game in forsaken more vendors will have more bounties on offer and some will provide legendary or better rewards for completing them it s fair to observe that we didn t answer every question you might ask about the return of bounties what would be the fun in that you ll discover exactly how they work and where you can find them next week and in all the weeks that will follow for the kidsat the time of this posting one storm is dissipating online while another one gathers in real life the guardiancon fundraising stream is over with millions of dollars raised

objects additionally some heroic strike modifiers will be given slight adjustments in response to player feedback test engineer drew martineau has a quick round of developer commentary on the goal of these changes hey all since the release of update we ve been collecting player feedback concerning heroic strike modifiers on tuesday three of the more punishing modifiers will receive some adjustments ultimately we want your power stats and armor modifications to matter and we realized that our debuff modifiers were a little too powerful to allow players to see their impact here s what you can expect blackout we wanted to ensure that enemy melees are threatening but this shouldn't dismiss a player s power progression or the stats they chose to invest in with their armor as such this modifier is changing somewhat it still increases enemy melee damage significantly but it s now no longer a guarantee of players being defeated by a single melee from many enemies be careful though if you re not at the recommended power for the heroic strikes playlist your enemies will be more powerful and pack a harder punch grounded there are many times players are considered airborne when they're not actually jumping to account for that we are reducing the damage threshold so players aren't punished for things outside of their control additionally we re looking to prevent players from falling to their demise from a height of meters just as they happen to land on a rock or some other small object glass this modifier reduces a guardian s shields and health while increasing recovery we slightly reduced the impact of this modifier to better enable players to see the effects of their overall power progression over time stay tuned to bungie net next week for the full patch notes expected to become available at a m pdt on tuesday july matrix reloadedover the past few months we ve been testing a new feature called the prismatic matrix when we first announced this new reward system we stated our goals for the experiment give players more control over how they earn eververse itemsoffer a more predictable path each week that guarantees access to specific itemsdrop fewer duplicate items this week the user interface calls specific attention to the limited time of the feature to explain our previous objectives and future plans here are some thoughts from the design team the original intent of the prismatic matrix was for it to be a special event something to help players round out their collections as the odds of earning the items that were eluding them improved as they continued to earn bright engrams we had a limited number of weeks scheduled designed to keep repetition to a minimum that schedule of curated offerings is coming to an end so the feature will be going on temporary hiatus starting next week thanks to some good feedback about this new feature we ve learned how we can make it better so we ll continue to support it in forsaken we look forward to your continued feedback and are excited to relaunch the prismatic matrix in the next season of destiny there will be more on this topic soon before the launch in september we ll update this conversation with a full preview for how the eververse trading company will be evolving to better serve you the player support report community management involves a lot more than going to conventions and posing for pictures serving the guardians is a team effort and some of us are more tactical than others the specialists on the player support team are experts on how the game evolves over time

event of season direct purchase will also be restored for iron banner in this update we re continuing to collect feedback throughout each event so make sure to sound off in the feedback forum with your thoughts on renown rewards and anything factions related after expo report after months of anticipation behind the scenes e has become a fond memory last week we took some time to let the dust settle and come back to our senses looking back on the events of the show we re sincerely grateful for the warm reception we got in los angeles and not just because of the sunshine it s always a rush when millions of people find out what we ve been working on it s even better when they get to play for themselves here are some thoughts from our away team of official spokespersons who were on hand to answer questions on behalf of everyone who is working to bring forsaken to life matt tieger game director high moon studiosafter so many months of hard work e is a glorious mix of relief and terror the death of cayde is a huge moment in the destiny universe and revealing that to the world was nerve-racking i get a sense that the community is incredibly motivated to explore the tangled shore and avenge the death of their friend as a game developer what more could you ask for steve cotton game director bungiei think it s fair to say that everyone on the team was both incredibly excited and a little bit anxious to reveal to the world how our forsaken story begins so it was amazing for us to see the response right after between the questions of why and how one thing was clear there was going to be consequence in this world of immortal heroes and this was going to sting to see how quickly uldren was elevated to every guardian s most hated enemy and how everyone s plans for revenge solidified almost instantly was inspiring some people at the show got to play some of the first mission of the game and we talked to them after there were strong feelings while they played but their plans to exact revenge only got more creative more personal in the end the show was an incredible journey of conflicting emotions and now i am left with an uneasiness every time i visit the tower cayde is right there and i just want to warn him scott taylor project lead bungieit was incredible to share forsaken with the fans and let them get their hands on gambit the teams at bungie and hms have been developing forsaken with the goal of reinforcing the hobby and the reaction we got at e meant so much to all of us there s a lot more to reveal this summer including details on collections

some love in update the raid team is excited to release prestige difficulty for both the eater of worlds and spire of stars raid lairs senior raid designer joe blackburn set some expectations in february and he's back to flesh out some details on what the experience will be for players taking on the new challenge hey everybody in destiny update we will be launching prestige versions of both spire of stars and eater of worlds raid lairs prestige raid lairs use new activity modifiers and a new system of curated loadouts to challenge you in new and exciting ways each week i wanted to give a quick rundown of what you can expect to get what you can expect to do and answer some questions you might have what you getwe believe players will be chasing after three different pursuits in the summer prestige raid lairs power weapons the only way to get power armor before forsaken is by participating in the summer solstice event but the only way to get power weapons before forsaken is by completing prestige spire of stars and eater of worlds every time you complete all the encounters in a prestige raid lair that week you will be rewarded a power raid weapon this can be any raid weapon from destiny not just the weapons that drop in that raid lair raid armor ornaments each prestige raid lair has its own set of unique armor ornaments exotic masterwork catalyst both raid lairs have a masterwork catalyst that can be found only as a rare drop in the activity what you doeach week there is a curated weapon suite and a global activity modifier for spire of stars and eater of worlds the weapon set and modifier will be the same across both activities curated weapon loadouts are based on weapon archetypes so over the summer you might see combinations that require you to equip auto rifle submachine gun sniper rifle or scout rifle hand cannon rocket launchersloadouts are not locked inside the prestige raid lair you can bring tons of different guns into a raid lair and swap between them at will as long as the gun meets the required curation for example if you were doing spire of stars and the loadout is auto rifle submachine gun sniper rifle you might want to use surous regime for val ca uor phase but swap to ghost primus for val ca uor phase so you can equip d a r c i for boss damage we are shipping three activity modifiers that the raid lairs rotate between two of these modifies are brand new and were built from the ground up by the raid team to work in raids the third is a fan favorite from destiny prism each of these modifiers is designed to provide guardians with advantages over their enemies when they lean into it the goal of using these modifiers and loadouts is to change the way you engage with prestige raiding each week the first week the modifier and weapon loadout might synergize really well with strategies and armor exotics you ve been using for months next week the modifier and weapon loadout might push you to explore the encounter in a different way and use different exotic armors looking at you lunafaction questions you might have is anything happening to the prestige version of the leviathan raid nope prestige leviathan will stay exactly as is this weapon curation and modifier will only apply to eater of worlds and spire of stars but in it might be worth going back and playing some more leviathan prestige to see if callus has a new way to enhance one of your favorite exotic shotguns are prestige raid lairs getting per-encounter changes nope when we originally created the raid lairs we wanted to focus on making the normal modes of encounters the most complete forms of the experience we believe these modifiers and loadouts will create more variety in your prestige gameplay than small per-encounter changes we also believe that the mechanical complexity in destiny raid lairs is very high and we want to lean more into the moment-to-moment sandbox engagement in prestige how many of the prestige raid activities will be active each week all of them do you want to play all three prestige raid activities each week on three different classes for maximum exotic catalyst and power weapon farming potential go for it when will the prestige raid lairs become available current plan is for both prestige raid lairs to be active with modifiers right when the patch goes live we feel like this is in line with prestige being a new way to play each week instead of a one-time event but we are open to feedback on this costs and collectionsthe destiny forsaken reveal brought a lot to the table on what s coming in september but there are many questions surrounding new features that we ll be tackling leading up to launch this week we re hitting a few of the most frequently asked questions about the upcoming collections feature investment designer matt mcconnell is here to bring the knowledge what items from year inventory will collections track collections include any weapon armor piece ghost ship sparrow emblem or shader available in year of destiny is there anything i can dismantle before forsaken launches if you have an item in your inventory right now you can safely discard it and retrieve it from collections in september this does not include consumables so hang on to those if they matter to you if i dismantled something previously will it be waiting in my collections this september your collection will begin with every piece of gear that you were holding in inventory or within your vault upon the launch of warmind if you had dismantled an item prior to may it will not be available within your collections what items from year can be reacquired from collections with the addition of random perk rolls to items starting in year we had to make a tough call for collections we investigated numerous options for gear with random perks fixed collections perks buyback limits reroll mechanics and many others but each of these came with issues that impacted the collections experience in a negative manner ultimately we decided to disable purchase of all year randomly-rolled legendary weapons and armor we don t like keeping some items from experiencing the full collections treatment so we re looking at a long-term solve for storing your exact perk rolls in collections how much will it cost to reacquire items out of collections we re currently working on costs for item acquisition and will have more information at a later date we have two main goals when deciding on reacquisition costs reacquisition isn t a currency sink we aren t trying to make you spend all of your hard-earned glimmer we just want to make sure the items you find out in the world still have value players won t have to deal with currency conversions for example if a shader dismantles into glimmer it costs glimmer to reacquire if the shader came from eververse it will dismantle into bright dust and therefore costs bright dust to reacquire these same goals are true of all collection items note a lot of you have been asking about the cost of shaders we can say that they will have a cost to reacquire from collections but there will no longer be a cost to apply shaders to gear here s a quick example let s say you just got that sweet calus s treasured shader to drop from the raid you re able to apply it immediately at no cost if you want that specific shader on all your armor weapons ghost ship and sparrow you ll need to pay some glimmer to reacquire a handful of copies straight out of collections before we move along purple and gold looks fantastic on the upcoming tangled shore warlock armor set you heard it here first when reacquiring gear from collection what power level will they be collection items will come out close to your current power level but will require infusion to be ready for endgame activities this is a delicate balance of making sure collections don t create a leveling exploit but still providing items that are usable right away in most activities if there are things you re eager to know more about leave a post in the destiny forum of bungie net or sound off on social media we ll be watching for trending topics and working to get you up to speed before forsaken launches iron resolve each day destiny player support patrols the help forum to assist guardians in need whether it be an error code caused by connection issues or an item

expansion they were delivered in annual passanother topic of the stream was the new annual pass as the evolution of the expansion pass that delivered content like curse of osiris and warmind the annual pass is a new plan for how we ll give hardcore players more ways to fight their enemies collect new loot and customize their characters here is game director christopher barrett to tell you more about our goals christopher destiny year begins with forsaken and throughout that year we're going to be focusing our teams on delivering content that gives players reasons to come back to

season all players can expect new rewards to earn new crucible maps and modes improvements to gameplay features recurring activities special events and more this graphic puts everything we have planned for year two on the map we re excited for the second year of destiny you'll soon learn more about what to expect in the coming weeks and months leading up to september when forsaken and the annual pass officially launch lab report last week we rolled out crucible labs to give you a first glimpse of crucible content still under development this was our first experiment in the lab but definitely won t be our last senior crucible designer andrew weldon is here to debrief you on our conclusions andrew hello everyone thank you to everyone who participated in our debut crucible labs playlist last week understandably many of you are curious about the decision-making process behind developing showdown and deploying it with labs i wanted to take some time to talk briefly about these decisions what they mean for the first reveal of labs and how this first labs run will help shape our future every mode you ve ever played in destiny has been the product of design iteration playtesting more iteration more playtesting polish and final bug fixing this takes a lot of time and effort across multiple departments within the studio and as players you don t get to see it until it s finished and in the game or featured in a press event or public beta labs gives us an opportunity to open up some of this development process to the community so you can be there with us earlier but rolling out a feature like labs is not without risk we re showing you unfinished work that is below our shipping bar and we expect there to be issues that need addressing it was important for our first labs to be measured and cautious our primary focus for this first round was to make sure that labs itself worked and showdown made for a great simple test case that we already have some familiarity with shipping through crimson days and doubles now that we ve successfully launched labs we ll be able to consider more options over time ranging from new competitive experiences to more silly and just-for-fun experiments in general expect that any mode that deploys in labs has no concrete timeline or schedulemust not interfere with must-ship features and updates i e the summer update and forsaken labs modes are in addition to features you re already scheduled to receive can be iterated on in a semi-public settingcan succeed and be polished for a full release in a playlist or rotatorcan fail and never be seen againthe broad feedback to showdown in this setting has shown us there is a lot of room for improvement and that s ok some of your favorite modes in destiny have had terrible playtests where we re left wondering if we can even save them some modes that showed promise never came together the way we hoped and had to be left behind this is a normal part of the development process that we re inviting you to join and we welcome your feedback and criticism as we make decisions not only in this mode but in the future as well you may very well see showdown again in the future with changes based on feedback from this week and we have some additional labs experiences in the pipe in our summer update over time we ll continue to get into the zone and lock down the best process and path to deploying new experiences for you we re glad to have you along for the ride the night is dark destiny player support keep the trains running on time we don t have a lot of trains but they do keep you up to date on game-impacting issues and when fixes are on the way this is their report nightfall unique rewardsthis week destiny hotfix was released issues preventing

       " Document(page_content=\"this week at bungie we lit the iron banner again iron banner v is back for season to celebrate its return we added a reprised version of the bannerfall map to the playlist this was another fan favorite we brought forward by popular demand it will be available in the iron banner playlist until the next reset when it will become available in quick play competitive and private matches for all players of destiny you also might see it in trials this weekend but we ll know that for sure tomorrow hive annihilation escalation protocol has been live for two weeks now ever since the launch of warmind we ve seen guardians bravely battling hordes of hive on mars the bravest among you have gone on to defeat seven levels of bosses as always combat leads to feedback today we re responding to a popular request for new matchmaking systems that would unite nine players in battle lead designer jacob benton has some comments about this new activity in destiny what were the design goals for escalation protocol jacob escalation protocol was designed to be a high-difficulty endgame activity for a max-level three-player fireteam other players in the world can contribute to make it easier but they shouldn t be required as long as your team is highly skilled and coordinated we have received a lot of feedback since the original launch of destiny that players felt like reaching max power was not satisfying there weren t enough activities that required and rewarded that level of commitment escalation protocol was designed to fill that gap so this activity was not specifically designed for nine players other than raid activities all pve activities and private spaces are optimized for three players to allow for multiple types of activities in the space so no it wasn t designed for it but it s not a surprise that it s easier with nine players given how under-leveled most of us are right now we knew that players would use the same creative workarounds to get nine players into a space similar to court of oryx but we did not specifically tune the difficulty around requiring that many players any plans to enable larger fireteams in the future we ve had a lot of conversations here about what to do to answer the community s feedback we re going to continue to monitor as more players progress up to max power and are able to attempt escalation protocol at the difficulty it was designed for and we ll determine what if any action is necessary we also hear players are really enjoying large groups of players fighting against enemies so we ll use that feedback to inform our future plans armor updateswe kicked off the beginning of season with changes to exotic weapons what about the armor has been a popular question today we re going to start answering it this is the first wave of changes the next are currently slated to come in july sandbox designer victor anderson has the facts on what you can expect on may victor we ve received a lot of feedback on exotic armor in destiny with we introduced changes to exotic weapons to make them punchier and more compelling and with the release we're taking steps to update some of the existing exotic armor it s my hope that the changes to exotic armor will result in more interesting choices whether you're doing a strike or going for wins in the crucible when deciding to update the exotic perks our goal was to keep the identity of the exotics the same even if the way they influence your playstyle is slightly different with the release of we re updating six pieces of exotic armor two for each class and we will be updating more in the future please note that any mechanical changes are in addition to the already established effects unless explicitly stated otherwise titansynthocepsmechanical changes previously the perk adjusted your melee damage depending on the number of enemies surrounding you now it grants a flat bonus to melee and super damage when you re surrounded by three or more enemies the buff is retained for a short duration after you are no longer surrounded although synthoceps has gotten a fair bit of love in the crucible players are often focused on the increased lunge rate the outgoing damage bonus was hard to appreciate and plan around with it being so variable in nature with this change you will be able to feel the impact more often in all scenarios particularly in pve lion rampantmechanical changes you can hipfire while lift is active without interrupting it and your aerial hipfire doesn't have an aerial accuracy penalty the lion rampant was focused around lift and how it impacts your playstyle and tactics so we decided to push further in that direction emphasizing fast moving aerial assault hunterthe dragon s shadowmechanical changes dodging reloads all weapons simultaneously the effects of wraithmetal mail now also include a bonus to mobility although the dragon s shadow does have a small following we wanted to make it more useful in a general sense under even neutral conditions while keeping in the theme of a fast-moving ninja mechaneer s tricksleevesmechanical changes swapping to a sidearm while critically wounded greatly increases its damage we went for the fantasy of a holdout weapon the pistol tucked into your sleeve that you pull out in an emergency to save you these changes should let you turn around a fight more easily warlocklunafaction bootsmechanical changes rift reload is automatic instead of being activated on entry exit empowering rift makes weapons more effective at extended ranges players having to dip in and out of the rift to reload their weapons was not consistent with other rift effects particularly with the overshield effect on healing rift it s been made automatic to be easier to understand and use as this is a more offensive choice in terms of rift exotics we also wanted to further reward players who want to double down with empowering rift instead of playing it safe with healing rift sunbracersmechanical changes original effect replaced with increases the duration of solar grenades solar melee kills grant unlimited solar grenade energy for a brief time while effective under some circumstances in terms of things like flat damage output with your solar grenade sunbracers didn t feel flashy enough for gloves where your hands are perpetually on fire so while retaining the original flavor of the solar grenade exotic armor we ve scaled up the potential output significantly to give the player a strong taste of power on a more frequent basis

item equip functionality available through the bungie net api as such the ability to equip or unequip items through the api has been disabled until we can resolve the issue while players may still transfer items from character to character any item that is equipped will need to be unequipped within destiny before it can be transferred using the destiny companion app or any third-party application the ability to equip items is one of the most used features available through the api and the decision to disable this functionality was not made without our weighing the impact it would have on the community to preserve the meaning behind reaching max power we decided that this action needed to be taken once a solution to this issue has been identified we will provide updates on when to expect a hotfix that will allow us to enable these features once more stay tuned to bungiehelp on twitter for updates please recycle your -d glasses it s time for our movie of the week this is a

       " Document(page_content=\"game director christopher barrett as you know we ve been engaging with the destiny community to pivot and improve every part of our destiny experience this includes a commitment to the tone story and lore of destiny both in and out of the game this week i wanted to give a shout out to destiny s hard-working narrative group who has been collaborating with myself and the rest of the dev team on a whole bunch of new lore content that will be coming your way in the near and in some cases very near future while i can t tell you everything we ve been working on together i m happy to reveal that another free destiny digital comic warmind is headed your way this week written by mark waid dr strange and david rodriguez warmind and inked by kris anka runaways i hope you enjoy reading it as much as i did and if the week seems like a long wait i ve got more good news you can join us in celebrating the upcoming launch of destiny warmind with a few pieces of new and original warmind weblore now available here chris editor's note revised copy to accurately reflect the release date of the comic tyra ghost open a new file research notes tk- category clovis bray i don t like it when you call me that what ghost oh come now we ve been having this discussion for more than three centuries ghost is what you are my friend if you want a name so badly choose one for yourself maybe i will now that everyone s gone back to the tower and we re still out here i have plenty of time to consider what my name should be can you open my file while you ponder the possibilities if you insist thank you research notes tk- data recovered from freehold bray landing kirren found an entire cache of intact data cores there brought them back just before the attack on the city it s these little miracles that intrigue me so much fragments of memories frozen in silicon and quartz trapped in a moment that survives the end of a civilization centuries of decay and the predations of invading armies only to be recovered and end up as flotsam of a second war that this cache even managed to survive the collapse is a wonder and then the red war the probabilities of such an occurrence are tyra yes ghost ahem you re rambling again you said i should remind you thank you as i was saying this data was recovered more than six months ago but is just now being decrypted exabytes of documents and schematics have been decoded so far at first glance most of this was just the detritus of bray s work review notes payment records memos i did find some very interesting notes on a propulsion system design that i ve already sent to amanda and there are some messages between the sisters that will illuminate master melivander s work on the history of clovis bray but then i found something extraordinary the records were fragmented some files had been partially deleted but there s enough there to indicate that the bray facility at hellas basin was larger than we previously thought hellas basin the tourist spot the same and while we know there was a braytech futurescape there for promotional purposes bray even had an ai-led tour all indications had been that if any research was done there it was mostly for show low-level projects creating improved cold-weather gear and the like but if these records are correct the facility operated on a far larger scale it could have been the site of the initial warmind development perhaps even a core site for rasputin itself this could have been where the warmind was born you got all that from some fragmented files is this going to be like the time you thought you d identified a second warmind we spent a decade searching for charlemagne s vault i was correct about charlemagne existing just not about what it was if we hadn t done that research we wouldn t know anything about subminds rahool still disagrees rahool needs to get his head out of his engrams this is why guardians look for fragments of the golden age we are the descendants of a lost civilization only by understanding what was can we understand what we are now how the world we know came to be and each artifact we find helps us interpret what we already know adds layers new identities we are experimenting in the laboratory of time testing each observation through a crucible of evidence sometimes our conclusions change and with each shift we learn more of where we came from the next shift in our perceptions it may be on mars apocrypha in the beginning there were five yul the honest worm akka the worm of secrets eir the keeper of order ur the ever-hunger xol will of the thousands and they were virtuous in time yul spoke truth and bargained well its children escaped the fundament and spread throughout the worlds they followed the words of the deep and brought low many agents of the sky they took and a portion of all they took was returned to the virtuous they grew strong in time auryx learned akka s secret that he was stronger than the gods that they had given their power and in giving it was diminished auryx rose up and slew akka he took and he grew strong with akka s power after the five became four yul spoke behold my majesty behold my crushing might my staggering size my scales that shine with an oppressive gleam behold my wings which create winds that sweep through the stars together we have called life to fundament and made that life thrive protected it from extinction they are our hosts and we are their strength but we do not give we take for this is the struggle to exist we are not immune the weakest of us must give way to the stronger and xol felt fear cunning for it knew that yul would in time turn its teeth to xol but akka was not the only one with a secret xol had a pact with a forgotten child abandoned by its father the cursed one took a fraction of xol s power and in return xol took the heart from the child whose name had been struck from the world s grave the orphan called life out of death and fed that power to xol together they would find a new world to rule and the five became three i the child become herald death record these words they are not of the sorrow they are mine cryptarch from collapse and post-collapse incidents on mars an examination of ecological changes in the polar regions by master reinhart cryptarch we have detailed records of the expedition sent to the moon to battle the alien race known as the hive the calamitous results of that assault and the subsequent lunar interdiction that was lifted only after definitive evidence was found that the interdiction had not restricted the hive s movements rahool et al the great disaster from burning lake to the hellmouth however there are indications that while that event may have been the vanguard s first engagement with the hive earth s moon was not the first place the hive made contact with human settlements golden age records detail an extensive network of clovis bray structures on mars the vast city of freehold served as the bray headquarters but ancient mass-transit lines that lead from the remains of freehold across the planet reveal multiple other sites including the clovis bray health center in skyline and an extensive futurescape near core terminus in the hellas basin region it is the futurescape facility that is of interest when considering the effects of ecological changes in the collapse and post-collapse eras although there are records that show that just after the traveler s departure the region had a mesothermal climate with an average temperature of c the region s ecological zones today range from boreal to ice cap near the planetary pole with harsh winds and a thick layer of ice that has made exploration in the region difficult what caused such a drastic change in the climate if it were related to the cessation of traveler energy during the collapse then we would have seen similar effects on other planets in the solar system which we have not if we cannot look to the traveler for causation then we must contemplate other external factors recovered satellite data reveals that the climate change in the hellas basin region was too rapid to have resulted from long-term ecological damage as it had on earth in the pre-traveler era in fact data from warsat j f s which crashed and was recovered near freehold indicates that the climate change on mars may have happened over a matter of mere days however this warsat was heavily damaged during reentry and the data may be suspect until we have a secondary source for corroboration this is mere supposition nonetheless if we accept the data from j f s then we are looking at an external endothermic event caused by artificial means on a scale so massive that it altered the entire climate of the region why would this have happened our only source is j f s and if it is to be believed an invasion of unknown biological entities including one of massive size was detected in the region immediately before the event could this have been a collapse-era attack with a weapon of unknown origin as of yet guardians have not reached hellas basin and we have not had the resources for remote exploration but if we did dig into the ice what would we find ana told you i remembered an article from the mars research we were doing at owl sector this could be what you re looking for if you can dig it out reinhart goes on for a few hundred pages from here i ll send the whole thing to jinju if you re interested but his conclusions are all wrong because he never mentions the one thing that could have done this there s something in hellas basin and you re going to be the one to find it camrinzavala ikora has confirmed my fears the ice on mars is melting she says it s the traveler s light that when it awoke it sent out a wave of light that altered everything it touched i don t know what to believe i look at the traveler now shining and alive and i remember all the times i begged it to respond to help its chosen through our trials i remember its silence even now it does not speak or if it does there is no one to hear and understand its words ikora says that we cannot understand the traveler or its desires they are too far removed from our own but can we rely on something that doesn t understand us to protect us or must we protect ourselves i think we must i have been searching the databanks records that even the cryptarchs cannot access and sifting through data that the speaker thought too dangerous to be disseminated i know what is on mars what is buried beneath that ice is too dangerous to allow back into our world it doesn t think like we do it weighs and judges our existence in its ruthless calculations and we don t even know what the goal is once long ago it might have been created as a tool to save humanity it is far more than a mere machine now and it is broken when saladin sealed all the records relating to siva he also put a lock on certain data concerning what lies hidden on mars we were stumbling around blindly in those days in the wrong place and at the wrong time calling out to something that could not respond or understand us and saladin let it happen because our failures were safer than the alternative but the locks are open now i ve studied the monsters in our past to prepare for the battles in our future i know how to reach this particular monster before anyone else does ikora is too intrigued by the knowledge it holds to heed the dangers cayde is wasting his time filling the prison of elders it s up to me to keep this secret buried to keep us safe

       " Document(page_content=\"this week at bungie we unleashed teams of six into iron banner we have a lot to cover iron banner v is in full swing exotic weapon previews have been dropping like loot we re following that up with some important info on power progression and reward changes coming in season on top of all this we re having special guests in the building to give us valuable feedback let s get to it crucible recaplast week we postponed iron banner while we worked out an issue in its place we rolled out a six-player version of rumble based on player feedback here is pvp design lead derek carroll with more info on the state of combat between guardians derek how did six-player rumble treat you we heard your comments and took action when the eight-player version got too big for its cage and we hope our work paid off there are additional map-specific spawning fixes that will be present in the next update so keep the feedback coming by the time you read this iron banner will be well underway as with everything we do in the crucible the true test is when players experience it out in the wild once you've felt how it plays we'd love to hear your thoughts meet me here in a week or so as you may have read last week we are changing the way crucible playlists work when season launches alongside the new expansion warmind beginning on may all destiny players will be able to compete on any of the crucible maps we put in our match-made playlists platform timed-exclusive content will still be limited to that platform but everything else is fair game we believe this is a big win for everyone since players will no longer need to choose between playing in a limited dlc playlist to see the new stuff and playing in a mainstream playlist to get the largest pool of opponents and maps more fun for everyone weapon showcase a few weeks ago we gave you a preview of upcoming changes to sturm and drang telling you what changes are coming is important but the old saying holds true a picture is worth a thousand words back in february we told you a few things we had planned for graviton lance earlier this week we showed off those changes in action those poor poor fallen that wasn t the only video we teased out this week you also got a glimpse of what skyburner s oath will be capable of in season now that we have shown you here is senior designer jon weisnewski to tell you more about what is changing about those weapons and another you haven t seen yet jon hello for some bizarre reason cozmo asked me to come back and waste some more space on the twab so here i am bloating the internet tubes with more bits and gigawatts what does that mean for you another update on the exotic weapon tuning headed your way this may today we ll talk about two guns skyburner s oath and rat king a while back i talked about graviton lance and how one of the main areas to improve was the lack of utility within a pretty successful show of spectacle skyburner s oath almost has the opposite problem it s a comparatively strong weapon effective at multiple ranges strong in ads and from hip with varying fire rates however it lacks spectacle to give it that exotic feeling it kind of plays just like any other gun to address this we started with giving the projectiles explosive rounds as their default impact response in ads the weapon will perform the same full auto slow firing high impact when firing from the hip skyburner s oath now lobs slower projectiles at a faster rate of fire that tracks targets and explodes the tracking functionality tends to draw projectiles to center mass rather than to precision regions so we reduced the precision scalar a bit and increased damage to the body precision hits still do bonus damage and overall dps is increased the end result is a dual utility weapon that fires hit-scan high-damage projectiles while aiming down sights and rapid-fire lobbed exploding tracking projectiles from the hip it almost feels like a rapid-fire grenade launcher that can transition to a precision death dealer with the press of a button here it is in action next up is rat king which already has something of a fan base but definitely has room to improve of the stats that improve with more fireteam members running rat king the strongest is probably the increased rate of fire unfortunately the dps potential is hard to realize because some people just can t physically pull the trigger fast enough to cash in on this benefit or don t know to try to make sure this is both felt and used we made rat king full auto to ensure the rate of fire increase can make a difference when running in a pack another pain point was that the restriction of having rat pack only activate when allies have rat kings equipped in-hand felt a bit too situational rat pack perk now triggers when fireteam members have rat king slotted as their kinetic weapon stowed or in hand we also front-loaded the stat benefits of rat pack so they increase a bit more drastically with one or two fireteam members and upped the base invisibility timer of vermin to seven seconds last but not least and not to overly tease but why not i m gonna tease the masterwork upgrade for rat king is going to put a tasty garnish on this meal you won t want to miss out on it s never a waste of space to have newsk stop by to share what weapon changes he s currently working on maybe we can convince him to come back next week to tell us about some more exotics we are buffing up for season power climbwe have received a lot of feedback on rewards power and how you want your actions to be more meaningful in determining how your character performs in the world of destiny we re planning some adjustments based on this feedback and senior designer daniel auchenpaugh is here to give you the details daniel last time i was here i talked about our adjustments to the raid rewards this time i want to talk about some more broad changes we re making to the reward structure of destiny one of the things we did when destiny launched was make the climb to the power cap fast and easy for everyone it didn't matter who you were or what your play style was the road to the cap was quick and accessible for everyone the result was that achieving the cap felt less satisfying it was easy and there weren t any activities that dared to require it so with the release of destiny expansion ii warmind we re making some changes to the size and frequency of upgrades these changes will apply to all of destiny not just the warmind endgame content our goals with this change are to bring back meaning and accomplishment to achieving the power cap to give players a sense of progression when they come back to play each week and to reward players who engage in a broader scope of the destiny endgame content we ve made an effort to de-emphasize grinding public events for exotics and to reduce the impact of clan engrams on endgame progression before we get into specifics i want to define a couple terms so we re on common ground soft cap is the point you can climb to easily via drops from any source the hard cap is the power level you can obtain from weekly reward sources the soft cap for warmind is and the hard cap is these numbers don t consider any mods remember that all drops are calculated using your best possible power regardless of if you have the gear equipped or not it can even be in the vault or on another character our target is that players who participate in all the weekly activities should take several weeks to reach the hard cap raids trials grant the largest increases clan engrams provide very small increases and the other weekly sources fall between those two players who don't participate in any group weekly activities are unlikely to hit the hard cap before the next release dedicated omnivore players will hit it before players that just play raids or trials exclusively additionally the final points from to will be significantly slower than to we expect it to take players roughly equal time to go from to as from to we decided to make this change because climbing to allows you to tackle endgame content without suffering a severe under level penalty but creates a significant accomplishment in achieving clan engrams offer excellent upgrades while a player is climbing to the soft cap they should grant awards an average of power higher than your current best possible while you're on the way there this will help players catch up with their clanmates who are completing weekly activities once you ve achieved the soft cap your progress is going to rely a lot more on your own achievements clan engrams above the soft cap will grant gear only points above your best possible in an effort to combat exploits around creating new characters to take advantage of one-time quest rewards we've decided to limit those rewards to the soft cap for the release they first appeared in this means destiny launch quests cap at before mods curse of osiris caps at and warmind caps at to compensate for their new caps they'll give you a large boost power when you earn them as long as you re below that cap farming exotics to increase your power has been removed if they drop from a non-weekly source they'll come out of the engram at the same power as a legendary would after you've gotten to the soft cap we believe the changes to quest rewards and exotic farming will ensure the most effective way to reach the power cap is to play the most challenges and social weekly activities thanks for hanging in there through this long explanation please let us know any feedback you have about this new way forward for destiny rewards we re going to carefully monitor feedback from this post and our early data after warmind launches to guide any changes we might make to this in the future so if you love it let us know if you hate it let us know that too high altitudethe guy who used to write these weekly blog addresses

on this new update want to see these changes in action we also put out a video showing off the hero moments you can expect in the new state of destiny if those videos have you asking questions all the juicy details can be found in our full patch notes we ve already got a lot of feedback about this update and will continue to monitor the conversation we know this hasn t addressed all of the concerns brought up by the community there are other hot topics we haven t discussed like random rolls weapon slots and progression systems our team has been exploring each of these concerns behind the scenes you ll see them front and center discussing their solutions in due time this game update was another step in the direction of our mission to improve destiny drang-o unchained with out the door we now turn our attention to if you have been paying attention to our development roadmap you may have noticed that exotic weapon changes will be a part of the next evolution of destiny we felt like now was a good opportunity for a little show and tell first off senior designer jon weisnewski is here to tell you a little about the changes we have for two of the less celebrated exotic weapons in the arsenal jon hello everyone i m dropping by for another tease of the exotic weapon tuning work being done for today we re going to talk about sturm drang for those who don t know the core loop of sturm and drang kills with one weapon reload the other while it s stowed consecutive kills with drang will overload rounds into sturm capping out at a round mag for a hand cannon currently the gameplay is focused on fast swapping and while fun this lacks that exotic flare we re hoping to add sturm is also a bit unwieldy to use so we re addressing that too as standalone weapons both sturm and drang have had their base stats improved for ease of gameplay drang now has rampage and a maxed out magazine to help rack up sidearm kills quickly the true payoff comes in the overloaded sturm magazine overflow rounds in sturm now have a damage boost of x this allows for a significant damage increase in pve and crispy precision -taps in pvp just don t miss now that we ve told you how these guns are changing let s show you how they re behaving with the current changes applied we ll talk more about the changes to exotic weapons in the weeks to come all of these upgrades to weapon performance will land in

questions of the creators on the couch alpha dogswith the introduction of scoring in nightfall strikes in update we decided to start showing off the highest scores each week right now it s more a contest of who can most efficiently clear lost sectors during a strike but we are working on some changes to that as it stands here are the top scores for last week even with the current methods available to run up the scores most of the community is putting up scores within our expected thresholds well below the outliers at the top only the top are breaking k each week we will continue to track these scores and evaluate if we should change up the thresholds for earning the emblems this is bat country the members of destiny player support are the watchful protectors always working diligently behind the scenes they are making sure you have the info you need to have the best destiny experience this is their report bat errorsat the release of destiny update we began to receive reports that players were encountering bat errors after completing matches when encountering these errors players would be returned to orbit and have to manually enter strike or crucible matchmaking to continue playing we have identified that this was caused by the strike and crucible repeat repetition feature introduced with and have since disabled the feature while players should no longer expect to encounter bat errors they will now encounter repeat strike activities or crucible maps when playing these activities we are currently investigating the issue to see if we can address the root cause of these errors and potentially re-enable the repeat reduction features issue progress tower black screensince launch we have been investigating an issue where players could encounter an indefinite black screen when attempting to load into the tower this week we have discovered the root cause and are aiming to address the issue in destiny update until resolved players may have to enter alternate activities from the director and attempt to re-launch the tower if they encounter a black screen error cream of the crop you got some movies for us send them to the creations page every week we pick a few to share here and we send them creators an emblem to show off to the community this week is no exception here is the cream of the crop movie of the week man calus phase

planned for season seasons team we have been reviewing player feedback on faction rallies and are planning to make some fundamental changes to the event here are a few of the overall goals we are trying to achieve pledging to a faction should be a meaningful choice rewards should not be time-gated faction rallies should provide a unique gameplay experience and not simply be a reward layer on top of the existing game the event should grant additional insight into faction lore and goals it should build upon player interest in lost sectors and armor ornament objectives i know you want the juicy details on how we are going to accomplish these goals as we get further along in development we will share more with you on how this event will evolve in the future what does high score mean every week we plan on showing you the three highest-scoring fireteams from the previous nightfall last week there were some monster scores on the pyramidion if you are wondering how these guardians were posting such astronomical numbers some of the hardcore players in the community discovered a creative method of juicing their scores in lost sectors we re looking at a fix in but until then we ll see who can be the most efficient at running up the score with these methods game on helpful companions there is a team that serves as the watchful guardians of the help forum you know them as destiny player support this is their report destiny companion appsince the destiny companion app update became available last week players have been reporting difficulties in applying shaders spawn effects modifications perks or masterworks to gear through investigation we have found that players who disable notifications on the companion app are unable to confirm the application of their desired changes if you are encountering this issue enable notifications to resolve this issue nightfall emblem variantsas of destiny update each strike offers a unique emblem that can be earned when the strike is featured as a nightfall activity additionally each emblem has multiple emblem variants that may be unlocked when players reach specific nightfall strike par scores we ve been witnessing some confusion in the help forum from players asking why they did not receive an emblem variant on their first nightfall completion even when they were meeting a par score there s a chance for emblem variants to be awarded to players upon nightfall activity completion when they meet par score requirements and it may take multiple nightfall completions to earn additionally emblem variants can be earned on either normal or prestige difficulty but some par scores may be achievable only on prestige difficulty the shape of destiny the creations page is where it s at for community art and videos since the beginning of time we ve been highlighting our favorite community-created videos each week and awarding an emblem to the creators make sure you go and vote for your favorites it helps us

it further and give it more polish and flexibility once we lock that down we'll release it into the weekly featured rotating playlist with the other fun stuff for now we are unsure of a release date but we ll add it the road map when we are more certain of when it will land there are of course other cool features coming in that will make everyone's lives better unless they're habitual quitters

common questions being asked about modifiers and score tiers we asked the team working on these changes to clarify a few things how do players acquire nightfall emblem variants dev team nightfall emblem variants have a chance to drop from nightfall completions it s not related to challenges and it s not a guaranteed drop for each variant the chance increases from to as high as at specific score thresholds per variant currently those thresholds are as follows tier ktier ktier ktier kwhy aren t those tiers visible in-game and will they ever change dev team we re planning to adjust the score thresholds as we come to better understand what the community considers an impressive high score and we don t currently have a great way to display dynamic settings like that every week that a nightfall returns we may increase the aura threshold based on community high scores from the previous week that nightfall was active we ll do that based on some percentile of the community potentially the top the current k threshold is based on internal playtests we expect the community to be better than us so it should be expected that threshold will increase the next time tree of probabilities comes around why were base nightfall modifiers removed dev team the removal of the base modifiers from nightfall is because we want to emphasize core combat in this initial release and let the community define the meta for a high-scoring nightfall run we can certainly revisit the modifiers in the future they re not dead and buried open to player feedback note we are currently investigating an issue where heroic mercury adventure modifiers are not appearing for some players this was not intentional and we ll update you on the status of the issue when we have more information we re planning on reporting the top three fireteam high scores each week right now json mercer and loaked are leading with a score of think you can best them before the reset we ll post the top scores next tuesday after the reset spawning woeswe are always squashing bugs in the live game you can read about a few issues we fixed with the update earlier this week some bugs are proving tougher to fix if you are a raider you may have experienced an issue we are currently investigating that causes some members of your fireteam to not spawn back in after a wipe we haven t solved the problem yet but we asked raid test lead john guesnier to shed some light on this bug and some possible workarounds while we work on a fix john hello i m the raids test lead for destiny i understand how frustrating it can be when players frequently encounter an issue in our raids nobody takes it more to heart than the test team creating complex encounters that function as expected is the pinnacle of what the raid team strives for in every release our raid team is made up of team members from all disciplines and when an issue can be identified and fixed by scripting what we call a content fix we can make that fix without pulling too many resources from what we want to share with players next when an issue needs to be fixed by an engineer what we call a code fix a solution becomes much more difficult to find as it touches all systems within destiny not just a specific activity the issue where players do not respawn in the leviathan raid is a memory issue due to the size and complexity of the activity and it will require a code fix it is caused when a fireteam splits up across large distances while others remain back and swap out their gear this has seemed to be occurring more often in recent weeks because we have updated our loot tables in order to make the leviathan raid a more rewarding experience with more incentives to return to we are still investigating a code fix for the problem in the meantime you can avoid this issue by sticking together as a team while trying out your sweet new loot we realize that this is not an acceptable fix but we wanted to give you info on how you can try to mitigate the issue while we work on it if you do happen to hit this issue even following those steps then reequipping the armor set you had when you spawned into the activity may return your guardian

the first of many from the sandbox team and that this meal will span many courses it s time for the next course senior designer jon weisnewski is visiting us from the kitchen with an update on the exotic tuning pass our team is working on diligently to make exotics more exotic-er jon hello players i m here to talk to you about the work going into the exotic tuning pass on the d road map when destiny first launched we built play-tested and shipped a batch of exotic weapons that we hoped would be worthy of your time and hype shortly after release we were happily inundated with a mountain of player feedback this allowed us to check our assumptions do some tuning and push out one of the first destiny sandbox updates which were solely focused on exotic weapons we re doing this again with destiny and this time we re including exotic weapons and armor gameplay goals for this pass tuning pass on exotic gear focused on adding and or increasing player power spikes focus on low-usage items but all items are being considered lean into an item s established gameplay and push it harder avoid catch-all improvements that dilute item identity so how does this play out we can look at graviton lance as an example the functional concept is a weapon that fires two cosmic void rounds that create a zero-air-resistance tunnel for a high-caliber precision shot to fire through the first two rounds have almost no recoil and prime the air and the third round does high damage with no falloff a kill knocks the body back with considerable force it tumbles and then explodes resounding player feedback has been along the lines of looks great sounds great neat explosion i can t get kills in pvp because all the damage is at the end of the burst kicks too hard for the follow up and i can t reliably damage targets with the death explosion in any activity because the body goes flying too far backwards all spectacle not enough utility to target the first pain point we reduced the recoil of the burst added some aim assist and changed it from three rounds to two this still plays into the fantasy of a low-damage gravity-neutralizing round forming a projectile tunnel for the last bullet it also allows us to ensure the damage per burst is at a competitive level for pvp engagements in fact it gives graviton a slight mathematical edge against other pulse rifles on the second feedback item we did some tuning to the ragdoll body we made it so that rather than violently flying backwards and likely out of range of a potential splash damage opportunity the defeated opponent floats back and up then we made the explosion bigger increased the damage and added some void field projectiles that seek out any remaining targets this is one of the more exaggerated examples to help describe how we re looking at our goals and applying them to the gear at the time of this writing the weapons that are not getting an update are merciless telesto wardcliff coil mida multi tool colony legend of acrius and vigilance wing some of the above perform well without needing changes while others like the vigilance wing pulse rifle are already benefitting from the tuning changes planned for update everything else has had some degree of power or utility increase whether it s simply bumping a stat or some deeper plumbing as described above we ll be touching a lot of powerful gear with this update and to truly understand the impact for players requires a lot of design iteration and test time it isn t enough to crank up the damage and run one strike or crucible match with a gun and helmet and move on dialing in the right amount of power testing in all activities with all types of load outs finding the bugs fixing the bugs updating the perk description text to reflect new behavior and then handing that off to localization for translation it s a ton of work but we re up to it we sincerely appreciate your patience i believe it will be worth the wait we ll be back soon to talk about exotic

enemies the balance has been threatened nightfall is upon us this burden of light has never been heavier we can sleep no more ulan-tanlast week we published a destiny development roadmap to forecast some changes coming to destiny you may have noticed some changes coming to nightfall strikes the nightfall has been the subject of a lot of feedback since launch many of you felt that the timer was pretty stressful and preferred being able to slowly work your way through the challenges at your own pace we plan to address this feedback with upcoming changes before we get to the details game director christopher barrett has some context to frame up the essential fantasy that we d like for the nightfall to serve barrett nightfall should be a challenging test that only the bravest guardians dare face fireteams of any size should be able to participate from organized clan groups to skilled solo players players should be able to determine their own challenge level by going slow and steady or fast and wild with elective modifiers to test the most hardcore veterans your final score will separate the best from the rest and with high risk comes high reward each terrible villain that players face should have a very rare and powerful unique item themed to them that tumbles to the ground as they collapse into a pile of bones conquering nightfall should be a badge of honor with the best players able to show off their achievements with new dynamic emblems and exclusive auras that s the vision of where we want to take nightfall you ll be seeing the first of this direction in the next patch with more being added over time with those goals in mind we asked designer john favaro and senior design lead tyson green to share some facts on how they plan to enhance nightfall strikes tyson as we are working on new sandbox improvements we recognized the need for a venue in which those improvements matter more the weekly nightfall especially on the prestige difficulty was intended to be such a venue but the controversial time limit mechanic is a simple pass-fail mechanism it only acknowledges success as being a clear with no degrees of success past that so no competition exists in that space it turns a lot of people off of nightfall too since it is both difficult and indexes performance solely on speed nightfall scoringwe are repositioning strike scoring in destiny to enable you to achieve something prestigious in the weekly nightfall and as a way to amplify difficulty the new scoring rules are intended to be better at a few specific things reward you for engaging and defeating enemies instead of running past them avoid over-emphasizing specific mechanics like precision kills that highlight certain areas of the sandbox and or punish other areas so that players are the ones who determine the most effective meta reward you for taking on greater challenges up to the limits of your own capabilities reward you for doing the above quickly and over the course of a short run versus long slogs over several hours the updated mechanics look like this scoring is team-based and the sum of individual performances a team should be able to focus on what works best not feeling put out by who stole whose kill scoring is primarily driven by kills and secondarily by orb generation we want you to find what works best for clearing strikes instead of telling you which weapons to use but we want coordinated use of supers and other team support mechanics to contribute to high scores we re interested in restoring special point awards based on medals but we want your input to understand the basic meta first score bleeds over time we are watching this closely score decay can feel bad but all else being equal a team that clears faster than another team should score higher score decay achieves this in the most transparent fashion scoring cuts off after time thresholds at minutes new points earned are reduced by at minutes you stop earning new points and it s a race to finish the run and post your score we want time to matter see above but we also want to avoid some of the problems we saw with prison of elders where a high score might involve punishing respawning combatants and yourself for a few hours until the novelty wore off a good nightfall clear shouldn t feel like a slog challengeon top of the above mechanics are challenge cards items that offer ways to boost the challenge in exchange for score multipliers in there will be a challenge card that drops from completing a nightfall run it has some customization options to help tune the challenge level to what you and your fireteam are capable of rewardsplayers will be able to see their and your scores on new nightfall emblems available as drops in each nightfall strike these emblems and others like them are now the source of auras which are automatically enabled if your personal score is above a global threshold at first the thresholds will be set based on what we think might be tough for players to reach but we look forward to you showing us how much we underestimated you then we can raise the bar based on community scores along with the aura a personal score over the threshold will also unlock a fireteam-wide buff that boosts vanguard token drops in that strike by when your fireteam sees the nightfall aura on your head they know who s hooking them up lastly some rarer variants of these nightfall emblems will be available as drops at higher score thresholds obtaining these rewards is meant to be challenging so we don t expect everyone to reach these scores or collect these items version update will have a first pass on this feature before we can call it a competitive activity we need your help pushing the limits and finding where it breaks future updates will react to your input as well as add more rewards and recognition to posting competitive scores we also hope to extend the challenge cards to support more difficulty customization and deepen the scoring options all of the feedback you give us in this release will go into making our upcoming releases better thank you in advance designer john favaro has some additional info about what you can expect from the new nightfall modifiers in the prestige mode john the current nightfall climate encourages play that pushes players through the encounters as fast as possible focusing on extending bonus timers and skipping encounters unless they are required which was more stressful than fun with nightfall strike scoring we were looking to give players a little more control allowing them to modify their experiences to provide them the challenge they want and incentivize more methodical progression through the activities people like big numbers and the best way to get big numbers is to kill everything we've been listening to the community's feedback and this is our first step in making a few improvements we're hoping you'll put some time in and let us know how you feel the modifiers will apply a multiplier to your score in the prestige nightfall it isn't all more more more though there are plenty of ways to lose points there is an ever-present score bleed to apply pressure to keep you moving and a timer that will reduce your multiplier if you take too long here are the current modifiers we re going to ship in this first iteration void solar arc singe currently provides a increase to player and enemy damage of the corresponding element extinguish fireteam wipes return the team to orbit power modifier voluntarily decrease your power to gain a score bonus these are just our initial modifier offerings this release is focusing more on how the system as a whole feels so we can get feedback on the core experience to fine-tune it before we dive in head first to creating additional modifiers there you have it if you still enjoy the thrill of racing through quickly you will be rewarded with a higher score if you prefer to go in solo and take your time you might lose some points but will still finish the activity and collect a reward you can complete the normal nightfall and get a score or you can take on the prestige nightfall and ratchet up your score with some modifiers we re eager to see you jump into the new nightfall and give us feedback on these changes raid plansanother thing that may have jumped out at you as you read the destiny development roadmap was that the eater of worlds prestige mode was pushed out until may you may have even said what is taking them so long it s a fair question the answer is that we didn t want to release it in its current form before rolling it out we thought we could add some more flavor to this special activity that will make it worth the wait here to tell you more about our plans for raid activities is senior designer joe blackburn joe hey guardians for destiny we wanted to release raid content on a more regular cadence than we did during the first years of destiny in our original estimation of this work we knew we would have to focus on normal modes forgoing lair challenge modes and having their prestige modes rely on enemies that are more lethal and harder to kill as we got closer to releasing prestige eater of worlds we knew we wanted to do something more over the past few months we have been prototyping a new way of adding difficulty and replayability to raid activities today i m happy to announce that we have decided to push this feature forward and release it for all the leviathan raid content with the release of expansion going forward all raids will all have a normal mode active at all times and each week one raid or raid lair will have a curated loadout mode this new version of prestige requires players to complete raids filled with deadly enemies using a curated loadout of weapons and a special modifier that enhances the way you play the raid team never likes to let you know exactly what to expect but let s look at some hypothetical examples these are not the plan of record but they give you a basic idea of what you might find week raid activity eater of worldsmodifier marksman precision damage is increased landing a precision shot grants one ammo directly to the

changes all the previous prestige changes in leviathan will be active when players engage in its new loadout difficulty the goal of the new prestige mode is simple provide new ways to engage with raid content each week new ways to engage with different weapons in your vault and new rewards to chase this is currently slotted on the roadmap for may but this is a major overhaul and could be pushed out further we ll keep you updated we can t wait for you to play it talk about it and help us make it better for years to come thanks joeget it off your chestlast week we deployed destiny update with it we shipped a temporary fix for a lockout on lost sector chests bringing the time down from minutes to this wasn t the solution we were looking for we have a better one coming to you next week so we invited senior designer alex velicky to explain what we have planned alex in the hot fix we ve fixed the underlying issue that caused the lost sector chest exploit players can now only open the boss chest once after killing a lost sector boss as was originally intended the chest may still respawn if you leave and return rapidly due to a larger issue with our activity tech that would require significant changes to fix but you won t be able to open it again you ll get the code required prompt unless the boss also respawns and you defeat them again we ve also completely removed the reward throttle from lost sectors as it is no longer necessary and we agree it was a poor player experience we want to acknowledge all of the interest we ve seen from players in us expanding the lost sectors system we agree and are currently looking into ways to do that we re not yet sure what form it will take and we don t have anything specific to talk about yet but it s something we re working towards

       " Document(page_content=\"this week at bungie we ve got details on the next update to destiny on tuesday faction rallies came to a close and new monarchy defended their title they are now two-time champions and they aren t shy about rubbing it in the other factions faces you can pick up their prize in the tower servants loyal to the new monarchy will get a discount everyone else can still get it but it s going to cost more glimmer perhaps future war cult will finally get a w the next time factions rallies returns until then we have a new event to look forward to salad barit s time a battle of guardian versus guardian returns begins tuesday january ends tuesday february the game is control this will be the first time lord saladin returns to the tower in season there have been some changes to how you ll go about decorating your guardian with relics of the iron lords first we are adding new items to the engrams you will find waiting for you when you visit lord saladin there will definitely be season weapons in the iron banner engram and we will be adding more in the next event here is a look at what rewards you can expect to earn next week hand cannon scout rifle shotgun the only thing not pictured is the iron banner ship we ll save that for when you discover it yourself if you are missing items from last season they will still drop as possible rewards from the engram there is also a new emblem that tracks how many lifetime rank ups for iron banner you have earned in destiny you can earn it by completing the iron banner milestone we've received a lot of feedback from previous iron banner events that players preferred a way to directly acquire items we have added the ability to obtain armor and three different weapons from lord saladin during each event here is what he has to offer next week the final way to earn rewards is by completing challenges ornaments are available for all your iron banner gear and you can unlock them by completing various objectives for lord saladin season ornamentsthere are no limits to how many engrams you can acquire or how many tokens you can earn get as much playtime as you can during the week it will always move you a little closer to opening another engram earning an ornament or purchasing a piece of gear from lord saladin go nuts masters of the armormany of you have already been discovering masterwork weapons and adding them to your collection next week we are adding armor masterworks to the mix all legendary armor now has a chance to drop as a masterwork the same rules apply as with the weapons you will have a higher chance of getting armor masterwork from trials of the nine and raid activities but you might get lucky with an engram from lord shaxx or any other vendor who offers engrams please note all raid masterworks must be earned from raid drops and can t be obtained from engrams or vendors in the tower the benefitseach armor piece grants damage resistance while using a superthis stacks for a damage reduction if you have a full set of masterwork armormasterworks armor can be reworked to a different stat package heavy light or restorative for one masterwork core and legendary shards you can now rework stats on your armor the results will still be stat packages that are found on other pieces there is a ui bug right now where if you try to quickly rework armor sets it will appear to rework to the same stats it doesn t actually perform the rework function or use your materials but can be quite scary so we wanted to give you a heads up this is just the first version of armor masterworks we are planning to continue updating this system and adding additional benefits as always if you have any feedback please let us know happy hunting raid reward renewalraiding is one of destiny s ultimate endgame experiences so far you have explored the mysteries of the leviathan and dove even deeper into its first lair the eater of worlds we ve received feedback that while the experiences were epic the rewards could use some more love we invited senior designer daniel auchenpaugh to tell you more about what we re changing with rewards starting with next week s raids daniel auchenpaugh with the upcoming january patch we're making a number of changes to the way raid rewards work we've been hearing that the current system doesn't feel exciting when you kill bosses that tokens aren't interesting enough and that you want more deep-chase items to hunt down this is our first swing at tackling some of those and we hope you'll jump in and play with these changes a bit and then let us know how you feel for now let's dive in to the changes and talk a bit about our goals and thinking with them raid armor now with raid perks raid armor now drops with perks that function on the leviathan these appear on mods that are selectable on both new drops and existing raid armor pieces you may alread have in your inventory additionally these mods are reusable if you swap to another one these will always be in the list to swap back to on your raid armor for the low low price of calus token since no one wants to take a - power penalty if they remove their legendary mods while in the raid all the raid mods are legendary by default this should also be extra icing on the cake for players who can t seem to get that last mod they need to max their gear out the goal for these perks was to elevate the power of guardians in the raid and we aimed to build things that were useful in every encounter as a result we avoided things that relied on specific mechanics to be useful and moved to broadly useful perks like recharge your grenade when you activate your super and deal extra damage after getting a melee kill as opposed to things tied to specific mechanics double dropsclearing prestige now gives you prestige and normal drops if you have the prowess to clear prestige then you've proven yourself enough that we don't need to force you to go back and do normal as well raid encounters always drop a raid piecewe didn't want players to have that dead encounter feeling anymore where they had already received all the rewards for that encounter and were just waiting on a later encounter or even worse the disappointed feeling where no one in your raid group gets something which could happen under rare circumstances in the old system so we've unified the drop tables for the encounters so that raid gear isn't tied to a specific encounter anymore with an exception i'll get in to down below so no matter what encounter you clear you can get raid loot oh and every encounter has a chance to drop an exotic not an engram that you have to take back to rahool for decryption but an item you could equip and start using immediately if you want this list of possible exotic drops is comprised of all non-quest exotics with armor and weapons weighted equally and is restricted to things your class can equip raid vendor sells a rotating selection of raid gearif you just can't get that last piece to drop for you we want to give you some agency with your tokens for a cost of legendary shards and some calus tokens you can purchase these pieces if you have completed that raid for the week for instance if you want to buy the prestige chest armor you need to complete prestige mode that week before you can do so this is so people can't save up tokens by sticking to normal mode and still wear the prestige gear we wanted to give people agency to fill in those few slots they're missing not negate the need to progress further in the raid ole benedict will change up what pieces they have available for purchase each week new item exotic raid ghost contender's shell while not quite at the grind level of the legendary nanophoenix we felt like we needed to add a chase item to the raid pool to make coming back still have reward potential each week enter the contender s shell this ghost can drop from the final encounter in either leviathan or eater of worlds we also included some bad luck protection to avoid the previously mentioned nanophoenix problem so that dedicated raiders can rest assured they'll get their hands on it eventually even if it takes several weeks the contender's shell comes with some brand new perks that we're hoping helps reward players that keep clearing the raid even after they've gotten their ghost both active only on the leviathan and its lair they aim to make leviathan encounter rewards stay awesome first seeker of brilliance enables the chance for encounters to drop bright engrams from their loot pools every time one doesn't drop a bright engram we increase the chance for the next remember those exotics that can drop from encounters i was talking about earlier well seeker of opulence means those exotics have a chance to pull from a list of exotics you haven't collected yet instead of the standard list lastly to top off this already pretty rad ghost we threw on seeker of glory which provides a tracker for the number of encounters you have defeated on the leviathan i realize this is a bit of an avalanche of text more than a wall but i wanted to talk about both what we were working on and why we did it i know we still aren't going to address every concern here but hopefully this is a start in good faith if we missed the mark on something please let us know additionally if you think we really nailed it with one of these changes please give us that feedback as well so we can keep doing more of that we're hard at work on the next month's update now but i hope next week you jump back in to the leviathan both raid and the lair and let us know how it feels patch note previewarmor masterworks and changes to raid rewards aren t the only changes coming in the upcoming update on january here is a look at a few of the other fixes you can expect to see in the full notes next week prometheus lensflame refraction perk now generates ammo instead of pulling from

adventuresfixed an issue where curse of osiris strikes were not properly granting clan engrams when featured as a nightfall activityfixed an issue where challenges were not appearing within quickplayincreased the dismantle timer for masterwork coresshader sit-down since the launch of destiny we ve gathered a lot of feedback on the new shader system as time went on and the shaders began to pile up players lamented the cumbersome process of trying to delete each shader one by one you ve been asking us why we can t just allow you to dismantle entire stacks of shaders i mean there are other consumables that can be dismantled en masse it s a totally reasonable question and we wanted to let you know the facts we re not making excuses or claiming this problem is too hard to solve we just want to be transparent about what the problem is and how we are going to go about solving it here is senior design lead tyson green to shed some light on shaders tyson green shaders are individual items and individual items trigger individual reward bundles when dismantled even when those rewards are simple that creates a challenge for us that we haven t yet addressed which is triggering dozens or hundreds of reward bundles simultaneously when an entire stack of shaders is dismantled this is challenging not simply because an arbitrary number of rewards need to be run and delivered simultaneously but because we also have to safeguard against scenarios where this produced items that couldn t fit in your inventory which could be instantly lost ex shaders that produce glimmer could easily evaporate into nothing if you were at or near the cap it would be relatively easy to find another button on the controller l x and let players actually delete a full stack but that isn t the spirit of what players are asking for so we re looking at a stronger solve in addition we re also looking at how to address other shader feedback it should be easier to get rid of a stack of shaders we are looking at mass exchange solutions we know you miss d armor shader mechanics looking at ways to re-integrate that capability without losing the ability to shade weapons ghosts ships sparrows or customize specific pieces of armor we also understand you want shaders to be more freely usable and not limited by availability we re looking at re-introducing shader collections or a way to get copies of a shader in your possession this work is ongoing and we ll go on record as to when the solution will land as we get closer to a fix that we test and certify for now it was important to us that you know it s on our workbench turning the pagerecently we unveiled our very first webcomic to call it the first implies that it would not be the last coming soon we ll be

dead orbit and new monarchy have seen their banners waving in the wind over the city will this be the moment for future war cult it s up to every player on every platform the balance of powerwhether you ve met osiris or not destiny has some changes in store for you with the beginning of season two some of the ways that all guardians fight have changed the patch notes tell the full story but the game designers can tell you to story behind the notes jon weisnewski has some developer commentary about the updates to combat jon hello guardians first item of business we know about the prometheus lens it s not what we intended the weapon shipped with a bug which we intend to fix with destiny update along with everything else in the december update until then please go easy on the players who have yet to get their hands on one we know you won t but it s been said as for the rest of the sandbox whether you're a long time player or reading one of these for the first time we're glad to have the chance to give you a quick update on the first of many destiny tuning passes our process for making these changes relies on a combination of absorbing raw player feedback consulting detailed player data and reconciling those learnings with our own experiences as players of the game we then playtest and fine tune the changes we make as much as possible in terms of dps output our data from the first few months of gameplay is showing that various categories of weapons are reasonably balanced a resounding theme from players has been to address the stronger outliers without making them too weak or changing their identity we agree we hope this update reflects that rather than try to address every feedback item with a potentially disruptive kitchen-sink update we're taking a more targeted approach for this first round of changes the main focus was bug fixes tuning adjustments and a few specific changes meant to address common feedback items just because we aren't addressing a feedback theme in this release doesn't mean we aren't aware of it or have no plans to address it in the future this was a calculated and stable approach for we'll see how this one plays in the wild and reevaluate going forward thanks for reading thanks for playing feedback frenzysince taking on the role of acting community manager i ve temporarily relieved cozmo on the front lines of player feedback don t worry he ll be back soon as part of keeping our promise for more communication between players and developers i d like to give an example of our process how is feedback collected how is it shared across the studio whether it s a post on bungie net a community forum or social media feedback starts with a conversation you and your fellow players chime in expressing agreement or disagreement with the given feedback as the conversation grows we share emerging trends with the entire team in a report that we deliver about twice a month when we identify a more pressing matter we share it directly and immediately with the teams that can make a difference here's one example as a player i wish to earn more meaningful rewards from pinnacle activities next week masterworks will be implemented to add more value to rewards that can be obtained from a variety of sources including gear from end-game activities but the work doesn t stop there planned for early we ll be looking at how raid rewards can be updated to create more meaningful experiences how exactly this will be realized in-game is something we ll detail closer to deployment but this is one example of feedback being investigated by our team we ll talk more about all the changes you can look forward to in the new year once it arrives you won t need to wait until next year to track our progress in responding to your feedback next week we ll be deploying a batch of changes in update that are based on your chatter you can find an itemized list of what s included in the same article linked above including some updates to the way vendors play a role in your hobby as a guardian keep the feedback coming we ll keep reading it even during the holiday break and we ll talk again once it s over the age of osiris

       " Document(page_content=\"this week at bungie we re tallying the rally the battle for resources between the factions is raging on all fronts can new monarchy or future war cult rise to the occasion and knock dead orbit off their black throne their fates lie in your hands each leader sits on their perch in the tower waiting for you to do their bidding in the wild which one will you choose we will find out who awarded the most packages and declare them the winner on november their banners will adorn our home and their chosen weapon will be available to all the price you pay will depend on where you pledged your loyalty high fidelity the holiday season is nigh so you might be compiling your wish list the playstation pro and the xbox one x are now both out there in the wild and either of them would make a great gift even if it s one you buy for yourself we ve seen a lot of questions about whether or not destiny would scale to meet the potential of new hardware on this festive occasion the answer is yes on december along with the launch of curse of osiris and season two we ll be deploying an update to destiny that will deliver stunning gameplay with high dynamic range hdr lighting to these new consoles you ll also see adaptive k resolution on the playstation pro and k on the xbox one x if you re migrating to these new consoles or already have we ll make it worth your investment answer the call starting on november the first clarion call for destiny will be live all weekend long this will be an opportunity for you to earn double xp for everything you do with a fellow clan member in your fireteam if you aren t in a clan this would be a perfect time to join one your increased gains will run from am pacific on november to am pacific on november if you are dedicated to playing solo there will be future clarion calls that won t require you to play with a clan social cuessince the first launch of destiny we ve seen a lot of feedback about the social features you use to share your adventure with other players social designers m e chung and steve dolan are here to shed some light on guided games in-game chat and that emote wheel we talked about a few weeks ago how is guided games going m e well one thing we're really happy to see is that guided games has enabled a bunch of new players to play the nightfall and or raid for the first time since destiny our goal with guided games for end-game content is about helping players find tight-knit communities to join but we see and are very aware of the current issues for example we know that the lack of reconnections causes all kinds of problems with unintentional oathbreakers that the lack of audio feedback when a clan is found is causing players to miss the queue that guides lack proper incentives that we need a guided games option for trials of the nine etc steve we have several of our superhero engineers working on really important things like network stability across the game but we hope to continue making progress on guided games as soon as possible here are some short-term fixes we ll deliver with the release of curse of osiris on december we've added an audio cue so that you know when you've found a guide full clans can now guide added reminders that if you reject a clan you're still at the front of the line so you can only pick guides with a mission statement that looks appealing guided games will support the new nightfall and raid content you ll find in curse of osiris and you ll learn more about that next week on our first livestream why aren't there checkpoints in guided games m e the original goal was to prevent checkpoint farming where players would start a game with a pickup group and drop right when they reached the right checkpoints to take to their buddies but not having checkpoints causes different issues that we're not happy with either we're still looking at this steve we also wanted to make sure every player had the same expectation of where you would be starting when you go into a guided game you will always start from the beginning we considered breaking up the starting points by checkpoints but our fear is that if we split up the matchmaking pools on a per-checkpoint basis we would make queue times even longer it's always a balancing act when putting new players together to play endgame content why can t players talk to their clans in the game chat m e oh man we want it in the game too getting clan chat into the game is one of our highest priorities and we hope we can get it into a release as soon as possible steve and yes we're interested in a tower zone chat too but we have to prioritize it against all of other asks will we see improvements to chat functionality m e we can do a waaaaayyyyyy better job in the game to encourage players to communicate like making more obvious public team channels and a good time to enter i e not when the player gains control when boots are on the ground or letting players know about chat setting defaults up front when you start the game or letting you know when someone is trying to whisper you etc these are the kinds of things we have on our backlogs but again everything is prioritized against all other asks what about that emote wheel we just heard about m e yes no one wants this more than me and we're trying our best to make it happen as soon as possible steve i've wanted this forever even without an emote wheel there has been amazing content put out by the machinima community i can't wait to see what y all create once the wheel is out and it's easier

faction tokens on first completion per character completing heroic public events now rewards faction tokens down from destroying enemy resources no longer rewards faction tokensopening lost sector chests now rewards faction tokens for each fireteam memberstrikes should feel more worthy of the time you invest in them we noticed that players felt lost sectors were useful but disliked the fact that they couldn t enjoy them with a fireteam so we moved the faction tokens from the destructible items to the chest at the end of the activity the destructibles will still be featured as a daily milestone and are still available to help your fireteam clear out the lost sector we re all excited to see which faction the players will help to win this faction rally we ll be watching and looking

leviathan on tuesday september at am pacific it s just over a week into the guided games beta and we want to update you on how things are going before we open it up for those brave enough to take on the raid senior designer steve dolan is on hand to give us a better idea of how guided games work how have guided games been going steve so far over seekers have been guided through the nightfall strike throughout those games over of nightfall attempts have resulted in completion even when the activity is hard guardians fight it out to the end you re an amazing community and we love hearing stories about players meeting their new clan through guided games some players don t have mics or have trouble speaking do they have to be in a voice chat steve even if you re unable to speak over a mic being able to listen in on chat can make a huge difference in your team s success nightfalls and raids are pinnacle content designed and tuned so that communication between players is essential to success guides and seekers are not forced to join the same chat channel after they land in the pre-game lobby but are strongly encouraged to do so before the fireteam leader starts the guided game if you use in-game chat you should already all be in a chat channel together guides if you re in a psn or xbox party be sure to invite your seeker to chat does finishing a guided game version of an activity advance milestones steve yes even though the ui tooltip doesn t mention the milestone it will advance when you finish the guided game version of the activity how does a clan get punished for being a jerk steve we review all reports on clan identity information and take action on objectionable clans if you come across a clan with an offensive name mission statement or motto file a report and we ll take a look if you re at the front of the queue for guided games we ll hold your spot in line until you re done with your report if a clan doesn t lead a good guided game their oathkeeper score will go down to get credit for a good guided game it must either finish successfully last as long as the activity or guardian oath or end with an agreement to disband when you get to the front of the guided game seeker queue make sure to check out a clans oathkeeper score before selecting them for the activity you re about to start if players are being offensive to you during a gaming session you should report that player via the in-game and console reporting functions what if the oathkeeper score is blank steve we don t give a clan an oathkeeper score until they ve run at least four guided games of an activity you can skip them or choose to trust a clan who has just begun to host guided games when players match with a clan do they have to wait again if they reject that clan what happens after they reject a clan steve we want you to be able to select a clan you want to play with when a seeker gets to the front of the line we show you a clan with which you have a good internet connection if you say no to that clan you ll go right back to the front of the line where you will match with a new clan soon find one that looks good to you before clicking accept sometimes life happens and players need to leave before they finish how do they leave without getting an oath breaker penalty steve when you bring up your ghost nav mode menu there is an option to vote to abandon the activity during a nightfall if all three players vote to abandon the guided game the guardian oath buff will fade and players are free to leave without penalty if you want to stick together to try the activity again outside of guided games be sure to get everyone into a platform party so that you can invite everyone to the new fireteam in the know community management is about

they can show you the way standing trialthe raid is not the final test that we have to reveal destiny still has new plateaus for you to scale bring a fireteam and your spirit of competition you have a new ritual to learn mutual combatwith more than one full week of player vs player action logged in our database we re ready to assess the situation in our arena before we step into analysis let s recap our goals the destiny crucible has been designed with two distinct playlists to serve two distinct moods quickplaymatchmaking times are shorter with less emphasis on skill fireteams with players of varying skill will have a better time this is the fastest route to a game but you may face opponents outside of your comfort zone competitivematchmaking takes more time to introduce you to players that are closer to you in skill with a good connection these matchmaking settings may take longer but we feel that the quality of the gameplay experience will be worth the wait at this time quickplay is working as we had hoped matchmaking is putting guardians through the paces players are meeting in battle for honor and bragging rights according to the finer minds on our team the competitive playlist needs some love too many players are getting stomped by opponents who grossly outmatch them in order to match you properly with an opponent in your league we need to apply your skill rating there is a bug we need to fix to ensure that this is done properly we are applying that fix right now in summary if you ve been having fun in quickplay nothing has changed game on if you ve been getting your ass kicked in competitive you ll have more of a fighting chance if you ve been kicking ass in competitive we re sending some worthier opponents your way the crucible exists in a constant state of evolution it adapts to the way you play so this won t be the last update we apply to the state of combat get out there and trade some shots with your fellow players tell us all about your experiences the first fireteam has made their way through leviathan shaxx isn t far behind emperor s respite is now available for all in the crucible pic twitter com cu av ezb bungie bungie september and now that we ve seen where the emperor lives we can enjoy some skirmishes there clan field guide clans are live the guided games beta is live guardians are forming up into their own special teams and fighting to make a name for themselves so they can lure new recruits into their respective lairs as you work together to define your own culture of teamwork and friendship we d like to share some of what we ve learned leading our own teams of gamers first up let s talk about identity how to write the ideal clan profile so you ve already picked the perfect clan name and clan tag but what about the rest of your clan identity seekers in guided games select a clan to go with based on what you ve shared about yourself so your clan profile should be designed to attract the ideal players you want to recruit for the activity let s start with clan motto it s your tagline and your rallying cry make it something memorable and leave potential recruits wanting to learn more some good examples from the wilds lone wolves banding together for the greater good pride in battle all about that glimmer wow that went way better than expected there is still so much left to burn while the motto is a chance to express what players should expect from you the mission statement is where you spell out what you expect from them it should answer some critical questions what behavior is acceptable within the clan what expectations do you have for communication and participation what activities do you focus on and what are the best times to play with your clan here is a sample we re a group of laid-back gamers here to have fun and make some friends while shooting baddies in the face message our leaders for an invite and let s go get that sweet loot we re usually online in the evening west coast time and like to hang out in chat while playing we do all the weekly activities nightfall raid and trials so tuesday and friday nights are busy play to win but have fun be excellent to each other with a detailed mission statement you ll appeal to the kind of people you hope to meet communicate the important stuff and have fun with it got it good luck wave those banners high too close for comfortearlier this week we were made aware that a graphical element on one of destiny s armor pieces bore close resemblance to an internet meme that has been subsequently repurposed to represent hate and intolerance this was completely unintentional as an immediate response we extended our planned maintenance window to remove the element from the armor piece itself and will be following up next week with another patch to remove the same element from the ui icon and preview screens scrubbing it from the game altogether like many of you we aren t satisfied with that reaction alone as the team was busy patching the game others were already asking the important questions the very same questions we know many of you are asking now questions like these how did it happen the design in question was initially created as part of gear foundry explorations in june of graphic designers routinely reference real world art iconography typeface and other design elements to inform the choices they make in this case some of the reference imagery featured the simple mirrored chevron shapes found in the finished piece some graphic design that belongs to sports teams provided some inspiration as well along with some primitive shapes and chevrons that were used to permeate our guardian class iconography how did we miss this content in development although the design wasn t emulative of the meme in question the armor piece was eventually flagged by another team responsible for reviewing content for cultural geographical and other sensitive issues unfortunately that review was conducted to explore whether or not we were comfortable with the connection to the original innocuous kek internet meme the more contemporary vile derivation that has been repurposed by hate groups was not surfaced through this process and therefore the armor was approved for ship what steps are we taking to ensure that this won t happen again we are digging in to determine how we can more deeply vet our game content to shield us and our community from inappropriate imagery though we are still investigating our creative process in full we know there was no degree of malicious intent from anyone on our team that said we do recognize that the design in question is close enough to warrant removal from the game we want everyone to know their identity is welcome in our studio and in the worlds we create this isn t merely a platitude but an official pillar we hold ourselves and our work to it is also a clarion call for the type of people we want to bring into our studio to help us make better games we aren t asking you for the benefit of the doubt we know we are judged by our actions we want to thank the members of our community and the press for bringing this matter to our attention we will always strive to make all players feel welcome in our worlds to promote positive experiences and to portray a bright and hopeful world in destiny and in every game world we create annoying

       " Document(page_content=\"this week at bungie we re about to launch destiny is almost here this will be our last weekly transmission before you get to play the full game in all its glory there has been so much said about this new adventure on the road to launch but we ve still seen many of you asking if there would be a live action trailer today it arrived we have a lot of information for you today tomorrow we head off to pax for a full weekend of destiny awesomeness next week is the main event if you are at pax you can play destiny you can sit in for any of our panels or you can score a ton of loot at the bungie store if you can t make it out to pax don t fret all of these items will also be available online in the bungie store we ll let you know via the official bungie twitter account when the new inventory is available for purchase if you re looking for something to pick up while you wait we do have a foundation pin and matching in-game emblem on offer with all profits going to direct relief in support of their hurricane harvey aid efforts for those who have already supported this much needed initiative or helped in other ways our team and the people of houston thank you for your generous support the beta and the omegathis morning the destiny pc beta closed up shop as far as tests go it feels like a huge success we learned a lot from watching you play and reading your feedback online thanks go out to everyone who joined us from whatever pc you were able to use to run the beta we ve gotten a lot of great insights from the pc community and we ll continue fine-tuning the game before the final release on october we can t wait to see you back again for the full destiny experience thank you so much for playing end gameafter launch there will be a few rituals and firsts that you might want to plan for as you ascend to orbit around the destiny endgame some of these activities will be ready and waiting as soon as you play your way through to them others will go live shortly thereafter giving you and your teammates time to prepare to get geared up and ready to go here are a few of the dates you should mark in your calendar nightfall ready when you areraid am pt september trials am pt september if you have witnessed the race to become the first to topple the final boss you know we keep raid info well under wraps these are your moments to discover your mysteries to solve we ve given you the when you will soon discover the who the what and the where together as a team you might even discover the how we ll be watching guided gamesguided games is a new feature coming to destiny that will help solo players link up with clans to tackle the most profound challenges in the game as a fireteam for guided games to have a successful launch we need time for enough players to form into real clans and be ready to guide other guardians if there are too many solo seekers and not enough clan guides the queues for matching will be quite long therefore we re going to roll out guided games as a limited-access soft beta where only a select number of solo players will be able to use guided games for the nightfall on this will allow us to slowly ramp up players over the course of september and allow clan populations to grow so that everyone has a great experience during the guided games beta period we need your clans to fully test the system at scale all clans will be able to guide solo players so once you ve mastered the nightfall fireteam up and guide solo players to the highest heights you may meet some new friends along the way nightfall guided games beta september th am - of players will be given seeker access depending on clan participation in destiny during the first week nightfall and raid guided games september th am target of players will be given seeker access go grab some big gunsif you are veteran of destiny you re probably familiar with the pre-decryption shuffle this is where you equipped all of your highest light gear before you brought your engrams to the cryptarch so you would maximize your gains in the past this was a little cumbersome at times and a huge bummer if you forgot a piece in destiny you will suffer those woes no longer psa in d it's no longer advantageous to equip your most powerful gear when decrypting engrams we check for your best possible loadout now mark noseworthy knowsworthy august now the game will automagically determine your power potential and give you the reward you deserve without making you dig through all of your armor and weapons to equip your best stuff we recently cornered investment designer daniel auchenpaugh and compelled him to make some rare promises about character progression tell us about this new system when do rewards determine their power and how is it determined daniel rewards determine their power at the time they're earned this means that when an engram drops in destiny it decides its power at the time it drops also when we roll rewards we look at your character's level and your best possible gear to determine the power of the reward this is true for crucible end-of-match rewards engram drops strike rewards etc note that some sources can still produce better gear than others once you're exploring endgame content look for the powerful gear rewards in tooltips if you're hunting the best drops what gear do you use to determine a players best equipment daniel when we say best possible gear we look at what the best scenario is for your character across your account this means that if you are playing on your hunter like you should we might use the helmet you accidentally left in the vault the boots you just picked up but haven't equipped and the auto rifle that you forgot to transfer from your warlock gear on other characters in the vault in your inventory or currently equipped are all compared to find the best loadout you could have that s convenient what if i have a level hunter and make a new hunter so i can have hunters will all my drops be level gear on the new hunter what if i've got a ton of exotics daniel nope the system is smart enough to look at level requirements and make sure it ignores anything that is too high for the current character to equip it also obeys equipping restrictions so it understands that you can only equip one exotic weapon and one piece of exotic armor and figures that in okay what about the contents of engrams we haven t decrypted yet are they included when you calculate my best possible equipment daniel while engrams do set their power at the time they drop they don't roll what they contain until the moment you decrypt them as a result best possible equipment can't use their contents in its calculations if engrams set their power at the moment they drop how am i supposed to know which ones have the best gear daniel destiny 's engrams are pretty cool because they'll tell you right on the tooltip what the power they dropped at is this is the minimum power that will come out of the engram you ll understand more about how a new legend will rise in the form of your first destiny character when you play before that journey begins we wanted to share just one of the quality of life improvements that we re excited about we hope you find that destiny is a far more rewarding game than its predecessor the rolling red carpetvery frequently asked question what is the exact time i can dive into destiny the answer is dependent on where you live destiny will have a rolling midnight release across the globe you will be able to play the game as soon as it is am september anywhere in your country or in some cases region in the us for example that means the entire country is live when the clock strikes midnight eastern it s going to be a busy

smith thislukesmith august this is real life for years we ve been dreaming about the next adventure you d take with us in the world of destiny for months we ve been talking about it in a matter of weeks it begins these weeks will be fierce some of us have a travel schedule that will keep us up in the air longer than a blind nova bomb we have final preparations to make for your arrival we re planning an epic celebration you are the guests of honor the red legion are the party crashers the air in our studio is crackling with energy what excites us as we play final builds of the game at home is that we ve held so many surprises back for you to experience on your own journey today we ll pull back the curtain and tell you a little bit about how the things you do know have changed since the beta to fight to crush to conquer even if you were able to eliminate every last enemy of humanity from the solar system there would still be other guardians who would want to kick your ass whenever you engage your fellow players in the destiny arena like you did in the destiny console beta our designers are studying you they know when you play how you win why you lose and what you have to say about it they use all that knowledge in concert with our own playtest war stories to update an experience that is in flux until we rip it from their talons and press it onto a disc or a download server all of this has happened before and it will all happen again in the destiny pc beta that starts with early access on august last week we suggested that the new beta build will include some changes let s tell you more about the evolutions crucible design lead lars bakken has some information on how you ll meet new people in the pc beta lars during the console beta we learned a lot from the players who entered the crucible some of these learnings will be on display in the pc beta our core goals haven t changed we still want to serve all players who love the thrill of competition with fair and fun matches we have however done a bit of work under the hood one of our goals for destiny has been to create two different ways to challenge yourself against other players from this point forward to allow for more varied experiences between the playlists matchmaking for quickplay and competitive will be tuned separately along with some other changes to the rule sets for specific game types these are the moods we want to cultivate in the new crucible quickplaymatchmaking times will be shorter with less emphasis on skill this is the fastest route to a game but you may face opponents outside of your comfort zone the winning score in control has been extended from to to allow for more time to play and use your abilities because too many matches were shorter than we expected some guardians weren t even able charge their super we ve extended the trigger for the mercy rule so it will come into play less often competitivematchmaking takes more time to introduce you to players that are closer to you in skill with a good connection these matchmaking settings may take longer but we feel that the quality of the gameplay experience will be worth the wait we have also made improvements to the way we calculate your skill in countdown to better reflect how you ll perform against your opponents we always use an element of your skill rating when we match you with opponents or teammates whether in a pre-made fireteam or going in solo in all cases the average rating of the team is taken into account when looking for matches as always we ll be eager to hear from you all about how this feels sandbox designer josh hamrick has notes on how to survive when you come under fire in the pc beta josh first sandbox would like to give big thanks to everyone who played in the d console beta i can happily say that a lot of issues you all encountered are things we were tracking i can even happilyerly say that because of your hard work and dedication to making d awesome there were a few things you reported that have now been fixed seriously thank you with the pc beta coming up we ll have another chance to sample the mayhem this will be an opportunity for you to experience a few tweaks that have been made that will help make for a more enjoyable d experience all around here s a list of the major adjustments in the pc beta fixed infinite super glitchinfinite supers are all well and good until someone loses an eye fixed warlock glide glitchthis bug was awesome so awesome it hurt us a little bit to kill it thanks to those in the console beta who helped us track this down fixed infinite grenades glitchanother issue found with the help of our friends in the console beta thank you fixed warlocks now have the same melee range as all other classeswith the exception of where perks directly increase their range warlocks will punch like the rest of us our pc friends will get a chance to experience a world with consistent base melee ranges so will the rest of you when the game launches tweaked globally reduced the time it takes to charge your superthis was a big change that came directly from your feedback during the console beta we agree it was taking a bit too long to cook up a super tweaked increased grenade damage in pveincreased damage helps grenades feel as powerful as they should facing hordes of alien combatants and more specifically makes the longer cooldowns more palatable we want abilities to be slightly more rare but worth it in the console beta the worth it part wasn t quite there yet tweaked increased power ammo drops in pvethis is something we had felt internally and have been slowly tuning up over the last several weeks the pc beta has been updated with our new values and will provide much more power ammo in pve than what was found before power ammo can also be directly farmed from all yellow bar combatants go big guardians we know you ll be doing everything in your power to discover shenanigans sandbox is optimistic that with these big changes to the build the pc beta will be several steps closer to the game you will find in your hands in less than a month from now we will be playing and watching right alongside you all ready to document additional issues that you might find along the way happy hunting eyes up guardians even if you re not equipped with the exotic gadgetry you ll need

been an exciting week a beta is a rare opportunity for you to serve as a volunteer on our development team as a product of the bungie community i can remember the rush of breaking new ground in a work

has been working with the team that delivered the beta to your console here s what he had to say about it jared the beta has been amazingly helpful for our development team the analogy i always give is that the beta is the plow on the front of the train that blasts all the snow off the tracks to clear our path we had many updates to the original but destiny is a brand new game using brand new technology in order to deliver an awesome experience this new technology needs a lot of testing this testing ultimately helps us validate that our new server model is working as we thought it would and at the quality and scale we had hoped it helps us evaluate our new tech advancements including enhancements you ll understand more fully when you play the full game ultimately it paves the way for us to have a much smoother launch when guardians finish a mission in destiny the takeaways are sweet loot and feedback about the moments of action that define the game at bungie we have an enthusiastic ear for what you say about your experiences in the wild the destiny beta has been a great opportunity to listen the test is far from over but beta design lead rob engeln has some acknowledgments to share mid-stream rob aside from testing our processes and services the beta is also an opportunity for us to collect feedback and data to help us close out the final tuning for the game we re watching and playing with you thank you for sharing your experiences and helping make the launch version of destiny that much better the pve game tuning has changed pretty significantly since the beta build was deployed the nature of a beta of this scale requires that it s based off a build of the game that is now months old so in many cases your feedback is helping us validate changes that were previously made based on internal feedback and playtesting for example we too felt that ammo especially power ammo was too scarce in pve in addition to retuning the drop rates we built a system that guarantees power ammo drops for you and your fireteam from certain enemies giving power weapons a more reliable and predictable role in your arsenal other areas where we ve made significant tuning changes include grenade effectiveness in pve boss vitality and weapon damage against non-player combatants there will come a time to share the full suite of statistics and the analysis what did we learn how many guardians shared a bubble with zavala time will tell this grand experiment is ongoing and we're tracking every data-point and forum thread tomorrow we open the experience to anyone holding a controller connected to a playstation or an xbox one on sunday we ll open the farm for one hour to see how players come together in the new social hub for destiny we hope you ll join us there is a certain equity in i was there before the game even shipped we thank you for being one of those people game on the rhythm of the algorithmbeta spoiler alert once ghaul kicks you off the stern of his attack ship you ll be invited to enter the new arena the destiny beta provides a preview for how competitive multiplayer is evolving alongside the rest of the game whenever guardians meet in glorious combat there are questions about how they were selected as opponents crucible design lead lars bakken has some answers for how you ll meet each other in the heat of battle lars hello everyone lars from the crucible team here aka thug larz on the internetz we really hope you re enjoying the beta even though it s just a taste of the full game we believe it delivers a good preview of what you ll experience this fall as you play your first matches in the destiny crucible you re probably wondering about how matchmaking will work before we dive into the details allow me to share our core design principles for the crucible in destiny provide a great experience for players who enjoy competitive pvp activitiesensure that players who enjoy pvp have fair and fun matcheswe re designing the crucible for people who live for that competitive fire that wells up in their soul every time they are challenged that s important to us so what s new for matchmaking in destiny the obvious pvp evolutions are the v format and the two consolidated playlists we hope these changes have a good impact on game quality destiny crucible matchmaking places a greater emphasis on connection quality but make no mistake skill is still a big component in finding worthy opponents for you to fight when all these systems are singing in unison it should help us reach our ultimate goal to give all players regardless of their skill the best possible experience while the new quickplay and competitive modes are designed to serve different moods they are using the same mm settings in the beta we ll be able to tune these separately post-beta and your playtesting will help us going forward for those of you who are wondering we bucket you separately depending on the playlist so your quickplay skill is tracked separately from your competitive skill tl dr we re always trying to make sure your connection is solid while also making sure we give you as fair a match as possible thanks again for helping us beta test the game we ll see you starside we re tracking all destiny beta feedback on the forum what do you think destiny has always been an experience that adapts to your

scroll to the first break for renewed marching orders from the iron lords concerned clan overlords have been asking us bungie will my clan be there for me in destiny the answer to this question is yes but the migration will require some action on your part every clan on bungie net is based on discussion groups that were infused with tech to transmit some crucial information into the game some of these groups even have a time-honored legacy that dates back to an ancient time when bungie net served the halo nation to enhance the experience of being in a clan in destiny we re breaking some bones starting on july clan leaders should visit their base of operations on bungie net and decide if they want to convert their group to a destiny clan clan founders will be able to transfer their title and permissions to another member who will be a more faithful leader for future adventures if you have bigger plans for the existing group that hosts your clan you can leave it as is and explore your own community purpose outside of the game this housekeeping period will last for one month after that time new clan creation functionality will go live on bungie net to support destiny stay tuned for

       " Document(page_content=\"this week at bungie our ears are ringing last week was an experience in sensory overload the aircraft hangar that our friends at activision built for the celebration was booming the response from the community has been thunderous you honor us with your enthusiasm for new action ever since the first reveal at the end of march we ve been hyping the destiny gameplay premiere on the internet inside our studio the entire operation was codenamed dre or destiny reveal event the games that were played in that fateful airport hangar came from the dre build the presenters who took the stage ran a gauntlet of dre rehearsals we knew this moment wouldn t be complete if we couldn t share it with our community if you made the trek to join us we were humbled and awed to hear you roar as your favorite class activated a new super for the first time if you piled into the stream audience to make the chat run like a raging waterfall we thank you for helping us to break the internet if you missed a single moment of the premiere here s the full archive with all the lights and noise and games and conversations behind us we can safely say that dre is something we ll never forget destiny game director and master of ceremonies luke smith has his own recollections from the center of that storm last thursday was a blur amidst the fuzzy lines a few moments crystallized and burned into memory i ll remember the tireless effort on the part of the crew who was there all week building out the hangar steph the stage manager helping us prep the team running the teleprompters which none of us had ever used before and a ton of other folks who made that event go i ll remember the conversations with guests sharing their own stories of what destiny meant to them their friends families and communities it s another jolt of energy as we enter the final months of destiny s development i ll remember the moment i walked out on stage for the first time for the rest of my life and the text i received from my mother after it was over wondering if she should get into these destiny games when i retire she s and i hope to still be making them when she hangs up her scrubs see you soon -lukethanks for being the wind at our backs guardians as luke said there is more work to do with dre fading into memory we can return to our mission with a belly full of fire code wordsas we moved through the crowd of guardians last week many of you asked important questions about how destiny 's networking model will work the technology we use to bring players together in the world of the game touches on so many crucial topics we know that you re curious about everything from how your shots land to the protective measures we ll take to keep the community ecosystem safe these topics deserve careful statements from the people who own the code and a noisy aircraft hangar isn t the best place to do them justice now that the dust has settled and the ringing in our ears has started to subside i sat down with matt segur engineering lead on destiny to get some answers for you matt we've seen a lot of people asking about how the networking model works for destiny many are concerned by our announcement last week that destiny doesn't have dedicated servers while that s useful shorthand the full answer is more complex because destiny has a unique networking model rest assured that we re doing a lot of testing right now with players all around the world and working hard to make sure that your experience is going to be smooth on launch day so why no dedicated servers matt every activity in destiny is hosted by one of our servers that means you will never again suffer a host migration during your raid attempt or trials match this differs from destiny where these hosting duties were performed by player consoles and only script and mission logic ran in the data center to understand the foundation on which we re building check out this destiny presentation from gdc using the terms from this talk in destiny both the mission host and physics host will run in our data centers wait so we do have dedicated servers matt we don't use that term because in the gaming community dedicated servers refers to pure client-server networking models destiny uses a hybrid of client-server and peer-to-peer technology just like destiny the server is authoritative over how the game progresses and each player is authoritative over their own movement and abilities this allows us to give players the feeling of immediacy in all their moving and shooting no matter where they live and no matter whom they choose to play with why peer-to-peer are we trying to save money matt nope we've invested heavily in new server infrastructure for destiny including using cloud servers for gameplay for the first time we really believe this is the best model for all of destiny 's varied cooperative and competitive experiences engineering will always involve tradeoffs and cost-benefit analysis but as a team we ve got no regrets about the unique technology we ve built for destiny with destiny coming out on pc does peer-to-peer networking put players at risk of being cheated matt the pc platform poses unique security challenges for destiny but our security ninjas have spent several years building a plan for how to engage with this new and vibrant community we have a variety of top-secret strategies to ensure that the life of a cheater in destiny pc will be nasty brutish and short and regardless of what platform you play on all changes to your persistent character are communicated directly to our secure data center with no peer-to-peer interference does this mean i ll never see a player warp around the map or shoot me through a wall again matt we think those controller-throwing lag-induced moments will be reduced for destiny but we can't promise they ll be eliminated fundamentally we are trying to strike a balance between three hard problems make the game feel responsive make the game accessible to players all over the world and make the game fair for all we ll continue to refine that balance as players engage with the crucible in destiny so what can we expect at launch matt we have a beta coming up this summer that will be the first chance for players to get their hands on destiny and kick the tires on its networking we have spent a bunch of time working on matchmaking latency and responsiveness and we feel pretty good about it as with everything we do we'll be monitoring the situation after launch and reacting to the community's feedback to matt s final point the real moment of truth and understanding will come when you get to play that s when you ll know what we ve built when you tell us what sort of experience you ve had we ll know too this is our goal for the destiny beta your next obvious question is when is the beta we re still tracking toward a summer time-frame we re locking down dates and prepping builds as soon we know for sure we ll upgrade the beta forecast from its current status of soon with exact dates we hope to see you there this is the true test we ll need every guardian on hand to help us launch a game worthy

since the release of destiny rise of iron pertains to local network fireteam issues some players are currently unable to form fireteams with other players connected to the same router or home network in recent weeks we have identified a potential cause for this issue that was introduced by a previous destiny update internal teams are actively investigating ways in which to address this issue in hopes of implementing a solution in a future destiny update we would like to thank all players who have posted reports to the help forum concerning this issue as it has greatly aided in our investigations siva key fragment and skeleton key issuesalongside the local network fireteam issue we are actively investigating reports of siva key fragments or skeleton keys being removed from character inventory in many cases reporting players have stated that this issue occurs more frequently when characters have a full inventory of skeleton keys or siva key fragments additionally logging out of destiny either by changing characters logging out closing the game application or turning off a console after leaving common engrams containing these items within the game-world may lead to this issue occurring until resolved we highly recommend players ensure that characters have enough inventory space to collect these items when awarded and that players make sure to collect all common

next update to destiny will include some design work to refine weapon balance the exact release date is to-be-determined the full notes on fixes and changes are to-be-revealed with every content

our own gameplay experiences we ve heard the conversation about and felt for ourselves shotgun dominance yes we see you matador but we feel strongly that our goal shouldn t be to nerf them into the ground instead we re looking at solutions that could bring shotguns into a better state of balance with the rest of the guns in the game in doing this we would still want shotguns to be effective and fun to wield we could quickly and easily break shotguns and call it a day but it s important to us that we explore positive changes that can make destiny better for everyone ever since we opened that window into our labs work has continued to refine player-versus-player combat in destiny our current goal is to deliver a patch that will change up the meta before you have a renewed call to arms that s a forecast more than a promise but that s how things go when you re working in a world built from ones and zeroes testing and investigation are ongoing which means that we re closing in on a fresh

pinnacle of the destiny endgame is born of a sprawling development process that spans almost every discipline on our team on the live stream a designer and a writer talked about how their teams meld

foundations that have supported countless battles between guardians rocket scienceheavy ammunition is a rare commodity in the crucible and with good reason there are few defenses against a well-aimed rocket that lands squarely at your feet we limit the deliveries of purple crates to the battlefield to make those explosive moments the highlight of a match when we learned that some guardians had discovered a way to earn unlimited rockets we knew it was time for a bug hunt rather than punish players for playing the game in a way we didn t predict we ve been waging an investigation into our code these things happen so please don t panic we re on the case - and we ve slayed more dreaded bugs than these in the meantime trials of osiris is cancelled for this weekend the thought of a trials map being renamed rocket town sends a shiver up our spine the esteemed brother vance will be ordered to stand down trials of osiris will return of course - and that right soon - but we re going to

all the ways you can spend time using the companion the one activity that will have the single greatest impact on your player experience is finding new allies to back you up in combat no matter if your enemies are guardians or aliens we believe that destiny is more fun with someone watching your back the recruitment forum is always there for you to solicit allies but it s traditionally been a chaotic wall of potential fireteams we ve had some ideas for how that could work better and we ve been executing on them very soon we ll be enhancing our forum with new ways to form up and roll out

your thirst for action choose your ideal adventure from a suite of dropdown menus to see who also wants to embark on that specific mission if you don t find a fireteam that suits your needs you ll be able to start your own topic to rally new teammates to your side design the ideal experience to be shared with guardians you ve never met and ensure that they ll show up packing the gear they need to swap some tactical chatter with you once the call to arms has been issued sit back and watch your roster grow in real time of course it will be up to you to make the in-game connections needed to form

the only things about to change sub-classes can change weapons can change special ammo can change stay tuned to find out it s the question that drives uson the heels of the stream we heard from datto he had some things he wanted to know about the april update datto in last week's stream variks was no longer selling ships and shaders from year one will people still be able to get these after the april update or are they gone forever they re not gone forever you ll find them in reward packages that you earn when you achieve a new rank with the house of judgement please variks to earn his old wares yesssss datto does the taken spektar gear that is obtained from the sterling treasure boxes feature randomly-rolled bonuses or are the bonuses the same every single time like any of the legendary items that you earn in destiny the new armor will draw perks at random from a pool of potential attributes this includes the intellect discipline and strength ratings as well as the talent nodes regardless of the bonuses armor acquired from sterling treasure boxes will always start at light you'll need to earn infusion-fuel in the form of higher-level gear from the playable activities that grant those rewards datto are exotics also lossless with regards to the new infusion system short answer yes longer answer infusion works the same way wherever the node can be found in the april update the stronger item applies its full strength to the weaker item thus a helmet becomes a helmet as we re no longer splitting the difference datto if i have a year one legendary weapon that is returning to year two will i be able to infuse the year one version short answer no longer answer bringing selected favorites from the year one legendary arsenal forward into year two isn t like upgrading an exotic weapon in your collections kiosk you ll need to earn the year two versions of legendary weapons again this time from the reward packages that are granted when you rank up with the vanguard or crucible quartermasters datto you obtained the spektar hood but you also had the spektar infinite hood is there any significant difference you might be thinking duh datto if you just scroll up you ll clearly see that infinite is the chroma-compatible line for future war cult the thing is this question motivated me to post images of all the separate gear sets clearly marked to indicate their faction affiliations thanks for always asking the tough questions people and thanks to datto for helping us listen like he does limited editionsome accessories like cowboy hats or black shades are eternal other accessories like trials of osiris emblems go out of style after a season they pass into the realm of vintage fair warning you have several more weeks to earn this trials of

       " Document(page_content=\"whoa wait you say is this the bungie weekly update it was for many years today we're giving it a new name so it would no longer be confused with patch notes bungie has long enjoyed taking a moment out of each week to share something from our studio with the players of our games we may have outgrown the name in the complex era of destiny but we have not outgrown the weekly ritual of friendship other potential names that were thrown at us on twitter included quarter-monthly hugstravaganzacoffee talk with deejtraveler s talesdear diarythe salt blockshow and tellblog with benefitsdestiny demonstrative divulgefrom now on we ll just lead off the way we have been this week at bungie we re on final approach with the february update crimson days begins february th when we deploy a tower strewn with floral arrangements isn t all you ll find in the download we ve got a fresh round of revisions to the player experience there s plenty to talk about something for almost every type of guardian we ve assembled a squad of eager developers to shine a spotlight on their recent efforts let s begin special ammo inboundperhaps this has happened to you before you re about to begin what you hope will be an epic fight in the crucible your fireteam materializes on the surface of your favorite map in a haze of luminous energy the leader of your fireteam plants a flag in the opening pose-down maybe it s even you while you contemplate your favorite choke-point to set up shop the match begins and you re on the run you sprint down a lane that leads to that sweet spot where you always teach a clinic on how to kick some ass boom headshot looks like someone knew where you were headed and treated themselves to an easy first strike at your expense and you rage oh do you rage have you ever wondered how the opening sprint might play out if that clever sniper didn t have bullets right at the outset we ve asked ourselves that question senior designer derek carroll has the answer how will the february update change the special ammo economy in the crucible derek after the update players will start certain matches without special ammo once the match has begun those green special crates will behave in the same ways you re used to although you may be looking for them a bit more what motivated the new ammo economy derek the pvp team wanted to increase the use of primary weapons especially at match-start sniper rifles and shotguns in particular inspire great happiness or sadness depending on which end of the weapon you find yourself we wanted to somewhat delay that gratification and sadification in which playlists will these changes be part of the new meta derek please don t say meta meta meta meta deal with it where will snipers be shopping more urgently for their cans of whoop-ass derek all v playlists will feature the new special ammo behavior skirmish salvage elimination trials and any rotating v playlists are covered i will take special care to say that rumble is not a v mode and is safe from this change why not v people get sniped there too you know derek there s no proof of that no seriously there are several reasons to limit this change to the v modes first the larger gametypes are generally less sensitive to initial conditions which gives us more freedom to have special weapons going from the beginning also smaller gametypes like skirmish are a bit more hardcore with more weight applied to each player in the match so we felt we could try pushing primary weapons for those initial engagements conversely control is the friendliest place to enter the crucible so we wanted to make sure that we don t present new players with a fundamentally different game than what they re used to change is always met with debate especially when it results in fewer kills for some of you we welcome your voice in the conversation that is sure to ensue if you re one of those snipers who is used to firing the first shot don t lose heart you ll still have many chances to ventilate some helmets stand alone togetherwhen rift was the game in iron banner we heard from a lot from solo players who felt sidelined by the team activity it s true that a squad of lone wolves who meet for the first time in orbit will almost always find themselves at a disadvantage in a match-up against a clan that always flies together that s why scrubs like me join them skill is valuable but so is a trusted teammate who knows the sound of your voice we ve heard plenty of chatter from players who want to let matchmaking choose their teammates for them but wish their opponents would do the same if you re one of them you have a new champion his name is designer jeremiah pieschl we lovingly call him jerpie what are freelance playlists jerpie freelance v and freelance v are mixed-mode playlists that are only accessible by solo players no fireteams allowed freelance playlists will be available sporadically on the weekly rotators in your director what was the goal here jerpie the design goal of freelance playlists was to facilitate an even playing field both teams will be on equal ground though an advantage can be gained by opening a voice channel to team chat a secondary goal was to provide playlists with a wider variety of engagements featuring mixed-modes with all of their associated maps means players will have a much more diverse experience and see less repetition in the combinations selected by matchmaking what gametypes will we find in those playlists jerpie freelance v features a mix of clash control and rift freelance v features a mix of elimination salvage and skirmish look for them next week if you want to fight alone but with teammates and you want everyone else to do the same thing you re a freelancer band together and revel in your independence if you re in a clan i ll see you in rift evaluating guardiansmatchmaking has been under the microscope lately at bungie during iron banner we introduced some new settings intended to reduce lag earlier this week we applied those same settings to skirmish yesterday we brought rumble and control up to speed tomorrow trials of osiris joins the new-and-improved club crimson doubles and clash are also on our short list of playlists to update with better algorithms to sort you with a good clean fight we ll update you when we update the crucible our ability to wield instant server-side magic is limited to five playlists at a time in a future game update beyond february we re planning to apply these new matchmaking settings to all crucible playlists this conversation will continue and we thank you for being a part of it stay tuned out of boundsthe internet is a dangerous place for data with the february update we re installing a damage referee to keep more of us safe from bad connections recently i had the chance to learn how it works that conversation quickly turned into one of those moments when i smile and nod and pretend to understand what the very smart person is saying to me fortunately networking engineer paul lewellen was kind enough to go on the record about the newest addition to our netcode explain it to me like i m five what is damage referee paul damage referee is our code-name for upcoming changes to the way destiny handles things that can go wrong when you re playing games online our goal is to give you a better experience in the crucible when there are internet problems outside of your control what s the essential problem we re trying to solve paul in short we're trying to fix the internet streaming movies wireless connections the speed of light and a host of other things are all conspiring to harm your online experience normal network latency is bad enough but even simple problems become extremely complex when the information your console is sending and receiving can be unexpectedly delayed dropped duplicated folded spindled or mutilated it's impossible to solve completely but damage referee is our latest attempt to improve things for the vast majority of you so what will happen in theory if my connection is good paul if your connection is good a typical destiny pvp match should feel like your best ones do now obviously things won't always be perfect but we think you'll notice a positive difference pretty quickly your weapons will feel a bit more reliable your kills will feel a bit snappier and players with poor connections should be less frustrating to fight what will happen again in theory if my connection is bad paul if your connection is bad we'll be giving you even more reasons to improve it expect to lose fights a lot more often even if you think you shot first or escaped behind cover in time things will get much better once you fix your connection but at least you'll receive fewer angry messages in the meantime how will i know this is working will i see fewer red bars paul not necessarily the connection bars we show in-game are designed to give you a moment-to-moment idea of how good or bad each player's connection is to all other players in the game not to our servers there are many factors that go into determining your color on the coded scale even if your own connection is the best it can be terrible performance elsewhere on the internet can still compromise your experience when you see a red or yellow bar next to somebody s name it indicates problems with their average connection to other players and usually to you too if it s your own bar that s stuck on red our network troubleshooting guide has some tips to help you improve it we ll be looking at the data as always but we ll be listening to you as well this is brand new tech so let us know if you can feel the difference when it goes live next week meanwhile on the dreadnaught with all this talk about crucible updates the raiders among us are wondering if their reports of issues aboard oryx s fortress have been heard lead designer gavin irby has been listening our team has been crossing some items off his list when we download the update how will king s fall be different gavin if you ve ever been the runner in the daughters of oryx encounter you ve probably encountered an incredibly annoying issue where your camera would snap back to a default position we ve fixed that which should make the runner s job more enjoyable and the ogres gavin we thought teleporting ogres in the oryx encounter were totally op so we nerfed them into the ground actually there was an unfortunate issue where the bombs were capable of blocking the ogre s pathfinding that resulted in them occasionally making a very frustrating teleport to get past the blocked path oryx challenge mode should be a little more forgiving now and that s the first time that oryx has ever been described as forgiving when an update is actually an update as the february update descends upon your hard drive the first-responders of destiny player support will be at the ready to make sure all the bits land in the right place dps thursday feb destiny servers underwent maintenance in preparation for update with each update we encounter reports of players being required to re-download all update content in order to play destiny once again or general issues installing the most recent update we re aware that some consoles attempt to verify previously installed patches to ensure there are no issues with previously downloaded content do not cancel out of this verification or you will be required to re-download all previous updates please ensure that you have enough memory present on your console to accept the most recent patch additional information can be found within this help article additionally if your download stalls for an extended amount of time you may need to cancel your download and update manually if you experience any console specific error codes when attempting to download update troubleshooting can be provided by playstation support or xbox support finally
