      "This Week at Bungie, we are saying goodbye to Season of Defiance and welcoming Season of the Deep! In other words, it's the last week of the Season and we have tons of new content dropping in less than five days. So, let's start on the right foot recalling what we talked about last week, shall we? Last week topics: A preview of Season 21 armor and weapons. How the second week of Guardian Games went.We teased the new dungeon. Eververse got a storefront update.And now, what's on the menu for today:An overview of all major changes coming with Season 21. A first look at the three new Strand Aspects. An in-depth preview of the Seasonal Artifact. An update to how enemy shields look.A note from the Engineering Team.Updated standings of the Guardian Games and Guardian Games Cup. Introducing Asians@Bungie! The new Twitch Bounty emblem. Now that you all know what's coming, let's scuba dive into the TWAB, shall we? A TL;DR List of Season 21 Changes With Season of the Deep almost upon us, and with all the information we have already shared about it, some of you might need a refresher. Worry not, we are here to help.ECONOMY UPDATES Economy might sound boring at first, but when you start noticing how many things in the game depend on it... well, you start paying more attention to how it fluctuates. At the start of Season 21, we will have several updates to Destiny 2 economy. You can read in detail about them on the May 4 TWAB, but here’s a recap of the major changes: Rahool Exotic Engram Focusing: you can decrypt or focus Exotic engrams, with Tier 1 and Tier 2 options. Weapon Deepsight activation: there’s a new currency called Deepsight Harmonizer. Changes to crafting costs: Legendary Shards are no longer required. WEAPON SANDBOX TUNING During Season 20, we introduced a lot of changes to weapons, as well as special reticles that better represent the perks and different firing patterns that some of them have. We are doubling down on that for Season 21, with more informative and more visible reticles at high field of view (FOV) for Fusion Rifles, Hand Cannons, Sidearms and Trace Rifles, as well as special ones for several Exotics, like Devil’s Ruin’s charged shot or Lumina’s Noble Rounds.There are also some Exotic weapons buffs (Worldline Zero is back), reworks (Salvation’s Grip), some nerfs (Thunderlord was cheating a bit) and some damages fixes (Winterbite was scolded). And of course, there’s also adjustments to some Legendary archetypes and perks. You can read all about it in the weapon preview article that went live yesterday.ABILITIES TUNING For abilities, the best you can do is go and read the preview article we published on May 3. Lots of buffs for Supers on PvE, more Fragments slots for several Aspects, improved melees for Strand as well as lower cooldowns for Grapple, a few buffs to Stasis, and a long, very long etcetera.EXOTIC ARMOR TUNING Same story as with abilities. We have an in-depth article about the changes coming to more than 20 Exotic armor pieces. There are some big buffs in there, as well as complete reworks and a few nerfs to bring some outliers into line.QUALITY OF LIFE IMPROVEMENTS We are also introducing several Quality of Life (QoL) updates in Season 21. Here's a list of them, with further details available in the May 4 TWAB. New Vanguard bounties. Finest Matterweave and Rainmaker can now be consumed to earn the associated material. Good Boy Protocol coming back to the Tower. Certain Triumphs now boost the raid Exotic drop rate in The Last Wish, Deepstone Crypt, Vow of the Disciple, Vault of Glass, and Kingsfall. And they are retroactive. CRUCIBLE UPDATES In addition to bringing the classic Meltdown PvP map into rotation, we are making several changes and updates to how Trials of Osiris will work in Season 21. Our intention is to make a more rewarding game mode without taking away the challenge.Flawless Pool is being replaced by the new Practice Pool and Challenger Pool. There’s a new Trials quest for new players. Some Trials passages have been adjusted to provide a better experience. Elimination is out and Dominion will be the core game mode for Trials. Gilding the Flawless Seal has new requirements. There’s plenty of information about it in the May 4 TWAB in case you want more.Three New Out-Stranding Aspects Just two weeks ago, we teased the new Aspects coming to Strand in Season 21 as part of a new quest in which Lightfall owners will learn more about the Veil in Neomuna and earn a new Legendary weapon. We felt like you wanted to see a bit more, so even though you will be able to test them by yourself in a few days, we recorded some short videos so you know what to expect and you can start thinking of new builds. Enjoy.Hunter: Threaded SpecterActivate your class ability to leave behind a decoy woven from Strand matter that draws the attention of nearby combatants. After taking significant damage or when combatants approach, the decoy detonates, dealing damage and releasing Threadlings that seek out and attack nearby foes. Titan: Flechette Storm While sliding, activate your charged melee ability to leap into the air, knocking nearby targets away and dealing damage. While airborne, activate your charged melee again to launch a cluster of damaging, unraveling projectiles. Repeatedly activating melee will chain additional throws.Warlock: The WandererTangles you throw attach to enemies and detonate into a suspending burst. Threadling final blows create a Tangle.The Refundable Artifact is Almost Here! Are you ready to wield your new NPA Repulsor Regulator? That’s your new Seasonal Artifact, treat it well or Drifter might use you as bait.Remember that the Seasonal Artifact has changed a bit recently. With Lightfall, mods from the Artifact changed into perks that are always on when unlocked and you don’t have to slot them into your armor pieces. Starting with Season of the Deep, another change is coming: you will have the option to refund perks from the Artifact individually, one by one, so adapting to each activity and crafting the most focused build will be a bit faster and easier than before.But in order to make the most amazing builds, you need to know the perks. That’s an easy fix: Column 1 Anti-Barrier Auto-Rifle: Your equipped Auto Rifle fires shield-piercing rounds and stun Barrier Champions. Additionally, Auto-Rifles are always overcharged when that modifier is active. Unstoppable Hand Cannon: Aiming down the sights of a Hand Cannon for a short time loads a powerful explosive payload that stuns unshielded combatants. Strong against Unstoppable Champions. Additionally, Hand Cannons are always overcharged when that modifier is active. Overload Scout Rifle: Landing consecutive hits on combatants with any Scout Rifle you are wielding causes disruption, delaying ability energy regeneration and lowering combatant damage output. Strong against Overload Champions. Additionally, Scout Rifles are always overcharged when that modifier is active.Overload Trace Rifle: Uninterrupted fire from your equipped Trace Rifles causes the beam to stun combatants, delaying ability energy regeneration and lowering their damage output. Strong against Overload Champions. Additionally, Trace Rifles are always overcharged when that modifier is active.Unstoppable Glaive: Glaives you wield fire a powerful explosive payload that stuns unshielded combatants. Strong against Unstoppable Champions. Additionally, Glaives are always overcharged when that modifier is active.Column 2 Authorized Mods: Arc: The armor energy costs of all armor mods affecting your Arc weapons are significantly discounted.Authorized Mods: Void: The armor energy costs of all armor mods affecting your Void weapons are significantly discounted.Authorized Mods: Strand: The armor energy costs of all armor mods affecting your Strand weapons are significantly discounted.Authorized Mods: Melee: The armor energy costs of all armor mods affecting your melee are significantly discounted.Technicolor Siphon: Grants access to Helmet armor mods that combine the effects of the Strand Siphon and Arc Siphon mods.Column 3 Improved Unraveling: Increases the amount of damage dealt by unraveling a target.Deeper Origins: Greatly improves the benefits provided by the Unsated Hunger, Nanotech Tracer Rockets, Harmonic Resonance, and Noble Deeds traits.Unto the Breach: Defeating a Void Debuffed targets creates a Void Breach while your Void subclass is equipped.Electric Armor: Stay amplified longer while your Arc subclass is equipped.Thunderous Retort: Grants bonus Arc Super damage if cast while critically wounded or while amplified. Lasts until the end of the Super activation.Column 4 Strand Soldier: Your Strand weapons gain Unraveling Rounds whenever you gain Woven Mail while your Strand subclass is equipped.Overcharged Armory: Weapons with the Unsated Hunger, Nanotech Tracer Rockets, Harmonic Resonance, and Noble Deed traits are always overcharged weapons for you when that modifier is active.Protective Breach: Picking up a Void Breach gives you an overshield or refreshes your existing overshield.Counter Charge: Gain a stack of Armor Charge when you stun a Champion.Amped Up: Gain damage resistance while amplified. Column 5 Conductive Cosmic Needle: Targets affected by Strand debuffs take increases damage from Arc and Void abilities.Shock and Awe: Arc final blows while you are amplified summon a burst of lightning that damages and jolts targets.Supernova: Picking up a Void Breach causes your next source of Void damage to create a large weakening pulse.Squad Goals:Performing a finisher while you are amplified grants Amplified to nearby allies when your Arc subclass is equipped. Performing a finisher while you have Woven Mail grants Woven Mail to nearby allies when your Strand subclass is equipped. Performing a finisher while you have Devour grants Devour to nearby allies when your Void subclass is equipped.Lightning Strikes Twice: After throwing an Arc grenade, gain increased grenade recharge for a short time. Arc final blows extend the duration of this benefit.Updates to Enemy Elemental Shields We have one more update coming with Season of the Deep, one we haven't mentioned until today: we are changing how enemy shields look. To tell you all about it, here's the Destiny 2 Combat Team.Destiny 2 Combat Team: Over the past few years, the Destiny Dev team has introduced numerous changes to the core game experience as we’ve overhauled internal systems, as well as endeavored to make the game more accessible to our audience. The change we are about to talk about touches on both of these topics.With the launch of Season of the Deep we’re introducing a change to most combatant shields that will update their visuals across the entire game. This update had the explicit goal of not affecting Destiny’s existing gameplay, so this will be a visual-only change.This is how shields are nowThis is how shields will look starting next season:Given that the majority of these shields have been in service since 2017, the number of bespoke combatant shields has become more difficult to maintain as we’ve significantly expanded the number of enemy combatants in the game. To address this challenge, we’ve made a large backend shift to a new shield system that will be easier to maintain and improve upon. Which brings us to our next point: accessibility.When we decided to overhaul this system, we took the opportunity to create visuals that are more accessible for colorblind players and players with other visual impairments. As such, we’ve minimized visual information that is not relevant to gameplay in favor of bringing to the foreground more combat-relevant details. This primarily takes form in more clearly surfacing the unit’s shield element. Right now, the color of combatant shields are the only way a player can tell what the optimal element counter is. In the new system launching with Season of the Deep, we’ve included more visual artifacts with each shield type that indicates to players which elemental weapon types are best to use.As a final detail, we’d like to note that Immunity Shields (white shields) and shields for specific boss encounters will not be receiving this update. Due to their slightly-more-complicated nature, we’re avoiding making any broad changes which could unintentionally impact encounter mechanics, designs, etc. Stabilizing And now, a note from the Engineering team: As part of the work to prepare for Lightfall, we embarked on a large technical upgrade to improve our Destiny 2 services and hardware. This work included updating our services to use new technologies as well as preparing for hardware upgrades. In the long run, this investment in the back end of Destiny 2 should lead to a more stable and reliable experience for all players, and faster recovery in instances where service downtime does occur. The launch of Lightfall was a great example of this, with high stability and uptime for both launch day and the Root of Nightmares World First Race. However, as millions of players have interacted with these services, we have discovered some issues that we are working on addressing. A prime example of this is our background service update system. Typically, several days before one of our Tuesday updates, we will “stage” the update on our servers. This upgrades our backend services to the new version and means that during the Tuesday patch, we only take a brief amount of downtime before letting players back into the game. However, with our new libraries and code, we’ve discovered cases where the background update has put our services into a bad state, forcing us to bring Destiny 2 offline for extended maintenance.So, what are we doing about this? We have a team focused on making corrections to our new services, so that we can safely perform background updates again. However, while we do that work, we also want to make sure your Destiny 2 experience is as predictable as possible. Therefore, starting with Season of the Deep's launch (Update 7.1.0), we are moving to a scheduled downtime model where we bring Destiny 2 offline for an expected 1.5 hours on our update days. This will allow us to do our “staging” and rollout on the same day and should make the experience more stable and reliable. In the meantime, we will continue to monitor performance, upgrade hardware, increase service reliability, and work to give you a great experience each time you play the game. Guardian Games are Coming to an End It's the final week of the Guardian Games, have you made your class proud? Because Titans certainly are as they hold a big lead in the final stretch. No matter the class, watching you all take part in this friendly competition is always tremendously fun.

Their mission is to uplift their fellow AANHPI employees, provide Bungie diverse insight of AANHPI cultures, and to support local AANHPI communities. After many rounds of discussing creative directions, revising designs, and generous support from internal Inclusion Diversity & Equity and Consumer Products teams, they’re ready to debut the Stand With Asians pin and accompanying Harmonic Waves emblem: The design of the pin reflects Bungie’s geographical relationship with the AANHPI communities across and within the Pacific Ocean. The background is a topographical outline of the Pacific Ocean, the clouds represent our one sky, and the seven-petaled tea flower is our hope in sharing a cup of tea with all seven continents, and because Bungie. For the month of May, all proceeds from the Stand With Asians pin will go to International Community Health Services (ICHS), a non-profit healthcare organization based in Seattle that welcomes people of all backgrounds in need of care. Celebrating its 50th anniversary, ICHS was formed in 1973 by young Asian American activists to disrupt the systemic racism that denied health to Asian immigrant communities. Today, ICHS remains deeply rooted in the Asian Pacific Islander community and continues to serve immigrant and refugee patients in over 70 languages. They have been a leading voice in challenging anti-Asian hate and championing health equity for communities of color. We invite all allies to stand with AANHPI communities by purchasing the Stand With Asians pin which comes with the Harmonic Waves emblem at the Bungie Store and the EU Bungie Store – orders will open on May 23. The Harmonic Waves emblem will also be available without a pin purchase starting May 23 directly through the Bungie Foundation for a $10 donation. All donations received in May will support ICHS.A New Emblem for Gifting Twitch Subs Emblems! Don't you love emblems? Because we have a new one for you. Well, not only for you, but for everyone that takes part in a Twitch Subscription bounty on their favorite content creator's channel. Say ‘hola, buenos días’ (“hello, good morning”) to the Pulsar Approaching emblem. If you don't know how that works, or if you want to have one on your Twitch channel, we got you covered: just head to our Destiny 2 Twitch Extension support article in here. Those who have completed the Twitch Sub bounty can collect their new Pulsar Approaching emblem from Rahool in the Tower starting May 28 at 9am PST.Player Support Report I bring less of a “Kingslayer” and more of a “Star Baker” energy to raid nights. Known Issues List | Help Forum | Bungie Help Twitter PATCH LANGUAGE CHANGE Beginning with the release of Update 7.1.0 and Season 21 on May 23, 2023, we will be simplifying the language surrounding our patches. Previously, our Seasonal launch and mid-Season patches were called updates, and any patch between these two major releases were called hotfixes. We were also able to update some parts of the game outside of these planned maintenance vehicles. These updates haven’t had names and were only announced via @BungieHelp. Moving forward, any planned maintenance patch will be called an update. These will be communicated ahead of time via @BungieHelp as usual, will require players to download a new patch, and will change the game’s version number. Any unplanned maintenance patch will be called a hotfix. While we will still be announcing hotfixes via @BungieHelp, our goal is to also provide localized patch notes on bungie.net for any player-facing hotfixes. UPDATE 7.1.0 RELEASE SCHEDULE Next Tuesday, May 23, Destiny 2 Update 7.1.0 will be released. View our Destiny Server and Update Status page for maintenance times, as well as the timeline below (all times are Pacific):7 AM: Maintenance is scheduled to begin.8:15 AM: Destiny 2 is brought offline.10 AM: Destiny 2 will be brought back online. Update 7.1.0 will be playable on all platforms and regions.11 AM: Destiny 2 maintenance is scheduled to complete.For more information, please visit our Destiny Server and Update Status help article.LAST CHANCE BUNGIE REWARDSAs both the Season of Defiance and Guardian Games end, so does the chance to earn certain Bungie Rewards.Players looking to earn the following Bungie Rewards should complete the associated in-game achievements before their earn-by deadlines by May 23, 2023: Lightfall Legendary Pin Root of Nightmares Raid Pin Queensguard Title Pin Champ Title Pin The Hawk Replica Ship 2023 Guardian Games Medal Guardian Games Pendant For specific earn-by and purchase-by deadlines for each item listed, please see the Bungie Rewards page.PREVIOUS SEASON PASS AND VENDOR REWARDSAs we approach the end of Season of Defiance, players should ensure that they have collected any earned but unclaimed rewards from their Previous Season Pass page for Season of the Seraph. Previous Season Pass rewards can only be claimed up to one Season after a Season concludes.

Don't forget to finish those Seasonal Challenges you might have pending, maybe even unlock one more ornament for your ritual weapon or get one last Taraxippos roll. That and getting my vault in order is what I'll be doing, though I might need some help for that last thing, because I promised myself I would go under 450 items...‘Hasta Luego’ Br1. \n"

       "'This week at Bungie, we’re prepping for our big Showcase event later this month, detailed in an earlier TWAB. We’re also working with the community for a nifty new Exotic, detailing what’s next for Iron Banner in Season 18, announcing Rift coming back to regular Crucible, and giving one last call for that glowy glamour goodness with the Solstice event that’s nearing its end.\\xa0As we’ve already mentioned, we’re not going to be dropping any major news between now and the August 23 Showcase, but that doesn’t mean we don’t have anything to chat about. For this week, we’re keeping things a little lighter, so let’s start with what ol’ Saladin (oh, excuse me, I mean Valus Forge) has up his sleeves for us with Iron Banner returning next Season.\\xa0\\xa0Ready for this week’s TWAB? Let’s get into it.\\xa0\\xa0Iron Banner 4-1-1More Iron Banner is on the way next Season, this time sans Rift. To talk about more about what’s on the horizon, we’ve got Principal Designer Alan Blaine here to dive a little deeper into what’s next in Iron Banner and Crucible realms. Take it away, Alan!\\xa0\\xa0Alan Blaine:\\xa0Hi everyone. Now that Iron Banner is officially wrapped for Season of the Haunted, let’s talk about what we’ve learned, as well as plans for the next Season and the future!\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0First up, we’re adding the ability to gild the Iron Lord Seal with the next batch of matches in Valus Forge’s honor.\\xa0As for what else is new in Season 18, let’s talk about streaks. When we started working on Season 18’s Iron Banner, well before we launched Rift, we knew we wanted to come back to something more familiar after a Season of objective-based gameplay. Some of you have been asking to play Clash in Iron Banner for a while, so we decided to start there. With that aside, we still needed that Iron Banner twist—the thing that makes it feel unique.\\xa0\\xa0The core vision started with a conversation that sounded like, “What if when you went on kill streaks, Saladin shouted, ‘He’s on fire!’ and you lit on fire? And maybe when you got a kill, he shouted, ‘BOOMSHAKALAKA!’.” And from that chaotic conversation, Eruption was born.\\xa0\\xa0What is Eruption? Eruption is Clash with energy boosts based on kill streaks. It was affectionately called Streak Mayhem internally before we gave it a real name. During Eruption, killing your opponents scores one point and a normal amount of energy. After that, when you get your second elimination in a row without dying (assists count too!), you become “Surging.”\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nYou start lightly glowing.Kills start generating 10% Super energy and 20% grenade, melee, and class energy.You score 2 points per kill.When you get your fifth kill without dying, then you become \"Primed.\"\\n\\nYou begin glowing brightly!\\xa0Your team goes on the Hunt.Everyone on the team gains 5% Super and 10% grenade, melee, and class energy.You now gain 12% Super and 40% grenade, melee, and class energy per kill.\\xa0You score 3 points per kill.Sounds great, right? So, who wouldn\\'t want to be Primed? Well...You also have a 15-second timer on you.If the timer reaches 0, you erupt.Erupting kills you, which resets your streak and ends the Hunt.\\xa0Getting a kill resets the Eruptions timer back to 15 seconds.You are then marked for both teams, so everyone can see right where you are.\\xa0The other team gets 3 points for killing you.Choices.More than one player can be Primed at a time.We are excited to get Eruption into everyone\\'s hands, and we hope it continues to illustrate our desire to bring new and unique experiences to the Crucible and Iron Banner. One of the things we learned with Rift in this current Season is if we have a brand-new mode (like the most recent iteration of Rift), introducing it to everyone in a high-focus environment first highlights inevitable issues that any multiplayer game has. Instead, we are going to be moving forward with the Zone Control plan, introducing it as low-pressure Crucible Labs first to make sure it performs as intended in a real-world setting. Then, and only then, do we bring the new mode to Iron Banner, albeit with a unique twist.\\xa0We will definitely come back to Control and Rift for Iron Banner in the future but expect a familiar mode with a unique experience in Season 19. In the meantime, let\\'s talk Rift.\\xa0Think Rift, But Make It CrucibleRift won’t be in Iron Banner for Season 18, but that doesn’t mean this mode is gone forever. Most of you will be happy to hear that Rift will now have more standard overtime rules. For those who may not know what exactly that means, overtime is that added time put on the clock to give teams a shot at breaking any tie that may be in place. It also gives us Titans a fair shake to just go ham with those fiery hammers and hope for the best (just being honest).\\xa0 \\xa0Alan is back with even more details about what players can expect, including lessons learned from the rebirth of Iron Banner.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Alan Blaine: Season of the Haunted ushered in a new era of Iron Banner, starting with Rift. While the first week had a rocky start, by the end, many players were starting to develop new tactics and strategies for the mode, and the weekend games were some of the closest and well-played. Then the second week rolled around, and we fixed (most of) the bugs and everyone had a great time, right?\\xa0\\xa0We all know that change can be hard—especially unexpected change. Communicating changes that we don’t know will work out, communicating future plans when there’s no hard date, and balancing between opposing player bases all contribute to the complexity of the PvP-verse in Destiny 2, but this is the wonderful conundrum we are committed to. For now, this is what we’re happy to share with players, and we think a lot of this information is going to be exciting for many of you.\\xa0Time for some fun data: 1.5 million players played at least one match of Rift, and over 300k of you managed to reset your rank (and 150k reset it twice!). We definitely hit a few people just right—one player reset their rank 17 times last Season (in only 55 hours in-game!), and another played over 133 hours of Rift during Season 17.The community was also able to expose some flaws in the mode. We’ve already had a number of fixes go live in Rift, like making it so games ended properly if a Spark was dunked late, or that the Spark could always be picked up. We also made a few tuning changes, such as when we added a 3-score Mercy rule, as well as when we dropped the base mode time to 8 minutes.\\xa0\\xa0The number of matches that fully went to time dropped by 10 percent, and we went from having no Mercy criteria to 1/3 of matches ending in Mercy (at 3-0 or 4-1).\\xa0One of my favorite things about the new era of Iron Banner is the new rules we are going to be bringing in each Season. While Rift won’t be in Iron Banner next Season, it will be in a weekly rotator in the Crucible:\\xa0\\xa0Available to play Week 1, 8, and 14, as well as a Private Match.Private Match is where you can play any map you want, even the unbalanced/asymmetrical maps.Alongside the more standard overtime rules, we also expect Multispark to return in a future Season.\\xa0AFK protections have been updated to utilize Rift-specific events.Later this Season: We fixed a bug that didn\\'t allow you to always immediately dunk the Spark if you picked it up too close to the Rift.\\xa0For future Seasons:\\xa0Explorations with 3v3 Rift.\\xa0Allows use of smaller maps like Wormhaven.May also allow us to use slightly asymmetrical maps like Burnout.\\xa0Fixing scenarios where one team can play keep away with the Spark longer than intended.\\xa0Lessening the black screen time after scores.\\xa0Further measures to discourage overt kill-farming.\\xa0New Exotic Weapon Ornament? Aw, You Shouldn\\'t HaveWe talk a lot about Destiny 2 fashion, but the threads of style aren’t limited to armor. What’s a good look without the appropriate accessories, am I right? We’re excited about the new weapons and other gear on the way, but we think it’s time for a few more familiar pieces of equipment to get a makeover. Even better? We want you to decide which ornaments become a reality. Even better than that? The designs behind the proposed ornaments will be created by an artist from our community of Destiny 2 players that are pure magic when it comes to bringing the game into the real world through art.\\xa0\\xa0So, how does this work? First off, we are leaving it up to you in the community to pick which Exotic gets a community-created ornament. We have three options for you to vote on in an email we will send out starting on August 16:\\xa0\\xa0Arbalest\\n\\nSweet Business\\n\\nRat King\\n\\nOnce that spiffy Exotic has been selected, we will be working with the chosen community artist as we help them create three different weapon ornament concepts. Once we have three that are viable to be made into ornaments, we will have another community vote so that you all can pick your personal favorite. The winner will be approved to be made into a weapon ornament in the game, and then bam: new look, new you.\\xa0Here is a quick look at the full process:\\xa0Community votes on which Exotic to pick through email starting on August 16.\\xa0Community artist creates three weapon ornament concepts for the winning Exotic.\\xa0Community votes to pick their favorite weapon ornament concept.\\xa0Winning weapon ornament goes into production and is released in-game as early as Season 21.This will be the first community-created item that makes it into the game, and we are really excited to see how it plays out. We have picked an artist out, so please don’t feel the need to start any campaigns on whom we should pick. We also aren’t asking them to do this work for free and will be paying them just like when we work with other external concept artists.\\xa0We want to make sure we give our artist plenty of time to work on their concepts, so it will be several months until we reveal who they are and unveil their work for the next round of voting.\\xa0\\xa0Once we have picked the concept that’s ready to go into production, it’s going to take a bit to go through our content pipeline, so we want to set some expectations up front that you shouldn\\'t expect to see the finalized design in Destiny 2 until Season 21. We know... that is a long way out, but we’re glad you get to be along for the ride on this one and an important part of that process.\\xa0Community-created and community-voted, we can’t wait to see what you all decide.\\xa0\\xa0Last Call to Praise the Sun, Arms Up!This is just your friendly community manager reminder that this year\\'s Solstice event is coming to a close. This means you\\'ve got just a few more day to get in there and grab those goods, or just roast some s\\'mores over in Bonfire Bash to finish out any last-minute Event Challenges.\\n\\nOne more heads-up! Don’t forget that Event Challenges and Event Tickets expire at the end of Solstice and the Event Card itself will be removed. Get that Kindling, sparklify that armor, and scope out the Event Card upgrade if you feel like getting super fancy. Or not, totally up to you. Just please make sure you go say “Hi” to Devrim over in the EDZ. I hear he’s a great help when knocking out some of those specific Challenges when out for Patrol or running a Public Event or two.\\xa0\\xa0Player Support ReportDear Darkness, please block out the sun. Love, DPS\\n\\r\\n\\xa0And we’re back with our ever-stunning, ever-kickass Player Support team to give us the rundown of what’s coming down the pipeline regarding the current and immediate state of Destiny 2. This includes some Solstice tweaking, another reminder that the event is ending (Hey, we want to make sure you know, life gets busy!), and more behind the decision to disable in-game text chat. So, without further ado, let’s get this show on the road!\\xa0This is their report.\\xa0Known Issues List\\u202f |\\u202f\\u202fHelp Forums\\u202f |\\u202f\\u202fBungie Help Twitter\\u202f\\xa0SOLSTICE EVENT CARD EXPIRING SOON\\xa0Solstice ends soon! Players have until the weekly reset next Tuesday, August 9, to claim their Solstice Event Card rewards, spend their Event Tickets, and unlock the Flamekeeper title and Seal.\\xa0FLAMEKEEPER TITLE AND SEALMany players were able to claim Flamekeeper early due to a bug where gilded Triumphs unlocked before all the regular Triumphs had been completed. Players who unlocked Flamekeeper using the gilded Triumphs but did not complete the regular Triumphs will have this title and Seal relock next Tuesday.\\xa0TEXT CHAT UPDATE\\xa0Last weekend, an issue was discovered in Destiny 2’s text chat where a specific text string could be used to kick players in any activity back to the login screen. As a quick fix, we temporarily disabled text chat until we can fix the issue. Due to the complexity of this issue, we have been investigating the root cause throughout the week. Stay tuned to @BungieHelp on Twitter for updates.\\xa0SILVER ASH UPDATE\\xa0The issue where players would only receive one Silver Ash regardless of the number of Silver Leaves that were converted has been resolved, and players should now be able to receive the correct amount of Silver Ash per conversion on any of their characters.\\xa0KNOWN ISSUES\\xa0While we continue investigating various known issues, here is a list of the latest issues that were reported to us in our #Help forum:\\xa0Text Chat has been disabled due to the known issue above. We hope to have a resolution as soon as possible.\\xa0The Eternity Crucible map did not count towards the Flawless Seal’s This is the Way Triumph.\\xa0The rally flag sometimes doesn’t work in the second encounter of the Wellspring: Defend activity. This can be mitigated by waiting a few moments.\\xa0The Duality introductory quest doesn\\'t count Master completion for the quest’s objective.\\xa0The Takes All Kinds weekly Solstice bounty only progresses on Major Taken defeats.\\xa0Players can instantly die when mounting a Sparrow that\\'s parked next to the bonfire.\\xa0Players can sometimes die when transporting to the Nightmare realm in the Duality dungeon.\\xa0Glows on this year’s Solstice ornaments have an unintentionally reduced glow.\\xa0For a full list of emergent issues in Destiny 2, players can review our Known Issues article. Players who observe other issues should report them to our #Help forum.\\xa0A Titan, a Mashup, and... Minecraft Steve?!\\n\\r\\n\\xa0Hippy: Movies, we love them, right? We also love a good mashup which is exactly what we got when one player decided to take a shot at recreating the Vow of the Disciple raid in the world of Minecraft. Considering I can’t make a four-wall house that looks even remotely like a building, I can’t help but to find this impressive. Is it perfect? Nope. Does it need to be? Also, nope. It’s just a really cool effort that makes us want to explore in all of our blocky glory!\\xa0Movie of the Week: Vow of the Disciple raid meets Minecraft\\n\\n\\nSam: Two things: One, I am a Warlock, through and through. Two: I am not a very \"puzzle savvy\" Warlock. How do I know? Because I did the exact same thing this sweet Titan did, but you\\'re going to have to click on this link to watch it because TikTok is TikTok and we just have to roll with it.\\xa0Hippy: Hi, me again. Jumping in on this MOTW train once more to say that you can be your Bottom Dollar (see what we did there, b-because of the weapon... we\\'ll see ourselves out) we\\'re hitting that bonus slot this week! Can you really blame us? Just look at this LEGO perfection!

I love these two so much, that it’s probably a little weird at this point. Anyhoo, we all know that things have been a little strained for Saint as the search continues for his beloved, so we’re pretty darn stoked to showcase one art piece that shows the strong, yet weary heart behind the brawn for Saint-14 and the man that played with time itself to save him.\\xa0\\xa0Art of the Week: Just a City Age warrior and his helmet\\xa0City Age warrior with helmet, 2022#Destiny2Art #AOTW @A_dmg04 @DirtyEffinHippy pic.twitter.com/ULfaiYudx2— NINE ✨ (@ninerivens) June 7, 2022 Ivan: This piece touched me with a special tranquility and melancholic vibe. you can feel it in the colors and in the atmosphere.
