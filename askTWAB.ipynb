This is included in the Lightfall + Annual Pass edition or can alternatively be purchased on its own through the Eververse store. It is not included with purchase of Season of the Deep.Players missing their Dungeon Key from purchase of the Lightfall + Annual Pass edition need to log into Destiny 2 on the platform where that purchase was made to unlock the Dungeon Key on their account. At this point it will be available on all platforms linked through Cross Save.Dungeon Keys are applied to individual Bungie accounts and cannot be game shared.Anyone still experiencing issues that do not fall into one of the above categories can reach out to us via our Missing Eververse or Add-On Item contact form where we can investigate further.KNOWN ISSUESWhile we continue investigating various known issues, here is a list of the latest issues that were reported to us in our #Help Forum.Some players are unable to give out Commendations.Players can get stuck outside of the final boss arena after self-reviving in the Ghosts of the Deep dungeon.The Hive symbols in the side rooms of the Ghosts of the Deep dungeon’s final encounter do not respawn within an encounter cycle if a player dies before depositing their Vestige. They will re-appear as expected once players have completed a damage phase.The Sunbracers Exotic Warlock gloves are not extending the duration of Solar grenades.The cooldown timer for The Navigator Exotic Trace Rifle\\'s catalyst is missing a description and will display as a blank timer when activated.Getting frozen while using the Arbor Warden Exotic Titan chest can sometimes cause players to lose the Barri-nade class ability. Respawning after player death or unequipping and re-equipping the Exotic will restore the intended class ability.Getting kills with Skyburner\\'s Oath and Vesper of Radius is causing larger explosions than intended.Some Iron Banner weapons are missing their glare in the Crucible.The Athrys\\'s Embrace Exotic Hunter arms does not display the \"Strengthened Heavy Knife\" popup when activated in the Crucible. Players should note the Exotic is still working as intended, it is only the visual indicator that is missing.Guarding with the Arc Staff super while using the Blight Ranger Exotic Hunter head is consuming extra Super energy.The Stronghold Exotic Titan arms are not always granting the Restoration buff when expected.The new Season of the Deep Exotics are not dropping from the Vex Strike Force activity.For a full list of emergent issues in Destiny 2, players can review our Known Issues article . Players who observe other issues should report them to our #Help Forum.Instructions UnclearBruno: So, you all really liked fishing. Please, just follow the tutorial and do it as we told you. Use baits that are safe. Don\\'t try to push other Guardians in the pond with Swords nor Sparrows.
