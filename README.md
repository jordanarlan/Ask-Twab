# Destiny 2 Patch Notes Extractor README
## Project Overview

This repository contains the code for an extractive question and answer (Q&A) system that utilizes LangChain [^1], Pinecone [^2], and OpenAI [^3] to extract information from Destiny 2 patch notes. The patch notes are retrieved using the Destiny 2 API [^4]

## Features

- Extractive Q&A system using LangChain, Pinecone, and OpenAI

- Retrieves Destiny 2 patch notes using the Destiny 2 API

- Provides accurate and relevant answers to user questions about the game's patch notes. 

## Technologies

- LangChain: A framework for building applications with large language models (LLMs) through composability

- Pinecone: A vector database for managing and searching through vector embeddings

- OpenAI: A platform for creating safe and beneficial AI, including generative models and language models

- Destiny 2 API: An API for accessing Destiny 2 game data, including patch notes
