We wanted to provide more clarity on the change to the Ashes to Assets and Hands On armor mods in the patch notes we released after Update 7.0.5.0 went live earlier this week.Our patch notes made it sound like when both the Ashes to Assets and Hands On are equipped, only one of the mods will work. In reality, these mods can still be used at the same time, and the change here is that defeating an enemy specifically with the grapple melee will no longer double dip and count as both a grenade and melee kill. This change was made to make the grapple melee consistent with how other abilities in the game interact with these mods.On the subject of Strand abilities, we’re generally happy with how Strand is performing, and we’re continuing to monitor data and player sentiment as we move forward. We’ll be balancing Strand over time, but in the short term, we’re making some Strand changes in Season 21 as part of a larger ability-balance pass.

To tell you all about it, here's the Destiny 2 Combat Team.Destiny 2 Combat Team:\\xa0Over the past few years, the Destiny Dev team has introduced numerous changes to the core game experience as we’ve overhauled internal systems, as well as endeavored to make the game more accessible to our audience. The change we are about to talk about touches on both of these topics.With the launch of Season of the Deep we’re introducing a change to most combatant shields that will update their visuals across the entire game. This update had the explicit goal of not affecting Destiny’s existing gameplay, so this will be a visual-only change.This is how shields are nowThis is how shields will look starting next season:Given that the majority of these shields have been in service since 2017, the number of bespoke combatant shields has become more difficult to maintain as we’ve significantly expanded the number of enemy combatants in the game. To address this challenge, we’ve made a large backend shift to a new shield system that will be easier to maintain and improve upon.\\xa0Which brings us to our next point: accessibility.When we decided to overhaul this system, we took the opportunity to create visuals that are more accessible for colorblind players and players with other visual impairments. As such, we’ve minimized visual information that is not relevant to gameplay in favor of bringing to the foreground more combat-relevant details. This primarily takes form in more clearly surfacing the unit’s shield element. \", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': 0.7800105937280969, 'meta': {'name': 'This Week At Bungie - 05/18/2023', 'link': '/7/en/News/Article/this_week_at_bungie_05_18_23', 'pub_date': '2023-05-18T18:00:00Z', 'unique_id': 'blt00659ca627b99132', 'description': 'Under the methane sea', '_split_id': 7, '_split_overlap': [{'doc_id': 'f0e792581170188b71e4a4b97e621cc8', 'range': (0, 220)}, {'doc_id': 'c7e95a50c8197ee73693d2edddac843', 'range': (1660, 1738)}]}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': 'f945aa270096957e167e26c32afc9aa5'}>,\n",
