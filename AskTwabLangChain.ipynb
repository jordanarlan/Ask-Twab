You know the drill: go check how Eva Levante is doing, get the quest, complete the objectives, hunt some enemies in the EAZ, and plan how you are going to party for the next three weeks.</p><p>The goal is to have fun and to get some cool looking armor that you can improve while playing. This is your moment to get the perfect armor with perfect stats, no matter if you are a veteran or a new player. There\\'s also a brand-new Strand Rocket Launcher called Crowning Duologue to obtain and renewed versions of previous Solstice weapons.

We\\'ll have more to share when the article drops next week, so for now, let\\'s just keep the&nbsp;<em>focus on the current Season</em>.</p><h2><strong>The Winner of Our First Community Emblem Contest&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Two weeks ago, we announced our first-ever worldwide Bungie community emblem art contest with the help of the Bungie Foundation and as part of the Bungie Day celebration. Now it\\'s time to reveal the winner! It\\'s not an easy thing to do because you all have so much talent it hurts, but after going through dozens of incredible emblem designs and showing them around Bungie so employees could vote for their favorite, weâ€™ve chosen a winner.&nbsp;</p><figure style = \"margin: auto; text-align: center;width: 675px;\"><img asset_uid=\"blt9f7879843dbbef87\" alt=\"Emblematic Winner\" src=\"https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/blt9f7879843dbbef87/64b8e7c0b0191626e2b17c05/emblematic_winner.jpeg\" style=\"margin-top: auto;margin-right: auto;margin-bottom: auto;margin-left: auto;text-align: center;width: 675px;\" /><figcaption  style = \"text-align: center;\" style=\"text-align: center;\">A Guardian\\'s Notebook</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/a_w_mont/status/1677738778415300613\" target=\"_blank\">Congratulations to Alex</a>!

Which ones? The Exalted Truth Hand Cannon and the Unwavering Duty&nbsp;Machine Gun. This just means that Adept and standard versions won\\'t be rewarded post-match starting&nbsp;Season 22, but&nbsp;remember that you will always be able to get the latter by focusing engrams with Saint-14.&nbsp;</p><p>Unwavering Dutyâ€™s last available Trials weekend will be July 28, while Exalted Truth\\'s will be August 4. If you are still looking for their Adept versions or for some nice rolls (probably both), now you know when to be ready. One new weapon and a rock-solid favorite will be in Season 22 along with The Messenger, The Immortal, Astral Horizon, and Unexpected Resurgence.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Deal with Them</strong></h2><p>Solstice is a celebration of summer, so in a way, it\\'s also a celebration of the Sun.

You have the traditional bonfire that is very common around the world as a symbol of that change, and you and your friends&nbsp;get to play along&nbsp;with that tradition in the game. Remember that we are not Exos though. We only have one body, so we\\'d better take care of it. Drink water, wear light clothes, and apply lots of sunscre<a href=\"https://www.madpaws.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Cat-by-the-Sea-in-Summer.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">e</a>n.&nbsp;</p><p>And for those of you in the southern hemisphere who might be in the middle of winter, you still have a good reason to play Solstice. This event is about getting nice, new, cozy armor while igniting a huge pyre as fast as those pesky combatants allow you to, so it\\'s a fantastic way to stay warm thanks to the fire and Strand-powered calisthenics. Just be careful when those Taken march through the map.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><strong>â€˜Hasta luegoâ€™&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Br1</strong></p>',\n",
