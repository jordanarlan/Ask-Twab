Wherever you play from, there\\'s a passionate community with great teachers and great content creators that offer their insight and expertise. Today, we virtually fly to Italy to meet one of those creators in the international community. Say ciao (hello) to GiornoGaming.</p><p><strong>Come stai, Giorno? (How are you doing, Giorno?) It\\'s a pleasure to finally have you here with us. Please, would you tell us a bit about yourself, like how you started playing games, what got you into streaming Destiny, and the name of your wonderful, beautiful dog?</strong></p><p>Ciao, Bruno, and hi all! It\\'s an honor for me to be here! And she is Audrey, my wonderful dog that completely changed my life in the last three years!</p><img src=\"https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/blt88fce0ed58e905c9/6495d04b9c69d8224fc1bf46/good-doggo.jpg\" height=\"auto\"/><p>My name is Andrea, I\\'m 36 years old, and as you can imagine, I love video games! I started playing with very old systems, such as the Commodore 64 or my brother\\'s Amiga 500. I played lot of classic games on those, but the culmination of my formative years was when I got my first PC and I started playing arena FPS like Quake and Unreal Tournament.</p><p>From there, I played competitive Call of Duty tournaments for some years. But unfortunately at that time, the esports scene in Italy wasn\\'t developed, so after I finished high school and went to college, I stopped playing for a long time.</p><p>But while in college&nbsp;, I started playing Destiny, and it was love at first sight. I studied and worked at the same time, so I was more like a normal, casual player. But after seven years working as a 3D General Artist, I started creating some of my own content. First on YouTube, and then on Twitch. After one year, I took a risk, quit my job, and went full time... and here we are, with a dream job where I create a place for my community to share their passions with me.</p><p><strong>You are the first Italian content creator we interview for a Community Focus, so I think it\\'s a good opportunity to have you share something great about the Italian Destiny community.</strong></p><p>Well, we might be few, but we are great. Our community is very diverse. We have a lot of good PvE players, some speed runners as well and a cool PvP community. But you can especially see how great everyone is when we have a good time together, like at a community summit. That\\'s where you can see our true potential. Last year, with Bungie’s support, we organized an event at the Milano Games Week and over 500 people gathered around the stage. It was simply amazing.</p><p>We also have super nice Discord communities, where some very nice people are always helping New Lights and teaching raids and dungeons.</p><p>I have nothing but love and good words about the Italian community!</p><p><strong>I know making a living creating content is hard, especially in gaming, </strong>&nbsp;<strong>. Any piece of advice or wisdom for those reading who might want to give it a try?</strong></p><p>It is <em>very</em> hard! The world of content creation is a rough and as you said, making a living doing this is even harder if you don\\'t speak in English!</p><p>I don\\'t have an all-around piece of advice for creators, but one thing you really need to maybe become successful: consistency. Consistency is the key, especially at the beginning, when all the hard work you put into it might not seem to grant you any reward. But let me tell you, that\\'s the foundation you end up building upon.</p><p>Making videos or doing livestreams has to be like studying in school: you make a video, you watch and rewatch it, and then learn from your mistakes. Same for livestreams. Watch the recording two times and try to put yourself in your viewers’ shoes to study what is working and what is not.</p><p>And the most important thing is, well, having fun and being genuine. Your viewers know when you are faking it and not really enjoying what you play or what you do. If you don\\'t enjoy what you do, you won\\'t learn from it, and you won\\'t grow.</p><p>I started making YouTube content and streams for very few people at the beginning, and it was like that for a whole year before I saw any results. This is like a day-one raid preparations, but it’s a raid that keeps on coming and coming.</p><p><strong>That is some amazing advice, man. Thank you for your honesty. Let\\'s keep going with what feels like an obligatory question: Hunter, Warlock, or Titan, and why?</strong></p><p>Warlock main here! I of course have one character of each and use them , but when I face a real challenge, my Warlock rises above.</p><p>I love the fact that, depending on my build, I can be the support of the team and a kill-machine at the same time. No other class gives me that feeling, and that\\'s the reason I\\'m Warlock main.</p><p><strong>Ok, one more. Favorite loadout right now for Season of the Deep?</strong></p><p>This one is a bit hard.</p><p>I completed a solo run of the new dungeon, Ghosts of the Deep, with my Sunbracers build paired with the Conditional Finality Shotgun, Acasia Dejection Trace Rifle, and the Briar\\'s Contempt Linear Fusion Rifle. But I love to free roam and do Seasonal content with an Arc build using Fallen Sunstar, Path of Least Resistence, Riptide and, of course, Thunderlord!</p><p><strong>After all these years playing Destiny, what is something that keeps surprising you about the game? Everyone has something, or several things, that keep them coming back and I want to know yours.</strong></p><p>I am a raid guy. I think raids are Destiny at its finest. Nothing is comparable to the thrill of the day-one raid experience, and I always say that this is something everyone should experience at least once, even if you don\\'t complete it.</p><p>I was part of all the recent races, and even if we are not in the top tier, I don\\'t care. Doing the raid with your team is something unique and special. You will always remember stuff that happened the first time you do it, you will remember your teammates, and, honestly, it\\'s a great memory to have overall.</p><p><strong>We had a couple very special moments during a recent gaming event—one of them involving a certain legendary character we haven’t seen in a while... Can you talk a little bit about your reaction? </strong>&nbsp;</p><p>That was shocking! I was on stream that day watching the Sony Showcase, just expecting some new single player games, and then Bungie shows up, announces a new game and then shows us that cinematic... I was speechless when I saw The Final Shape reveal.</p><p>It\\'s awesome seeing Cayde again. Cayde\\'s death felt special, the moment he became a true legend, so I can\\'t wait to know more about what\\'s really happening in that teaser. I don\\'t think you are telling us the whole story!</p><p><strong>My lips are sealed, and I can\\'t say anything. So instead of resisting the urge, do you have any special messages for your viewers, the Italian community, or maybe for the rest of the team at Bungie?</strong></p><p>First of all, I want to thank my community! It’s because of them that we managed to be here talking to a large audience, and directly with Bungie!</p><p>To the Italian community as a whole, I want to say that I can\\'t wait to see all of you in person at the next community event.</p><p>And to Bungie, you just keep doing what you are doing. Keep giving us challenges and even more content for the years to come.</p><p><strong>Before we say arrivederci (farewell), where can we find you online? When do you usually stream? Would you tell your dog I love her very much?</strong></p><p>For sure! Audrey will love that! You can follow her on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/theoriginalaudrey/\" target=\"_self\">Instagram</a> if you want to see how beautiful she always is. I stream every day <a href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/giornogaming\" target=\"_self\">on Twitch</a> and also upload my content <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/c/giornogaming\" target=\"_self\">to YouTube.</a> My main social media is <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/giornogaming\" target=\"_self\">Instagram</a>, where I share stories and updates for my community very often.</p><p>Thank you very much for everything, Bruno!</p><p><strong>Thank you for your time and your words, Andrea. Hope you have a wonderful rest of your week.</strong></p><hr/><p>The world is big and wonderful, filled with people with different backgrounds that might surprise you and probably enrich your world view. Always keep that in mind when playing Destiny and you might learn a thing or two! Our community keeps growing with new players all over the globe. If you run into any Italian players, maybe ask them about how to make a good espresso at home. Best coffee in the world.</p><p><strong>Hasta luego,</strong></p><p><strong>Br1</strong></p>',\n",
